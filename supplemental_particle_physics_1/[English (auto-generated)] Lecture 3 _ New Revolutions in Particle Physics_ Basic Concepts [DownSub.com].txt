Stanford University all right so the

last time we were beginning to get to

the idea of a quantum field and that's

what I want to get to today what is a

quantum field I always it related to

particles we spent a little bit of time

talking about harmonic oscillators and

the basic mathematical tool for quantum

fields for any kind of fee twelve

quantum fields for any kind of quantum

fields is the harmonic oscillator and

putting how oscillators together to make

quantum fields so we talked about um

fields on a periodic space so I'm not

going to draw the periodic space the

periodic space is one which after you go

a distance L comes back to itself it's a

useful trick and the reason it's a

useful trick better than just taking a

finite line interval is because when you

have a periodic space you can have waves

which go in one direction always which

go in the other direction without

reflecting and that is the analog of

momentum Kyle it's not the analog it is

momentum conservation so if you want to

retain momentum conservation it's a good

idea if you want to maintain momentum

conservation and temporarily put a

system in a finite box so that you don't

have an infinite volume to worry about

then the right way to do it is periodic

boundary conditions and then under those

circumstances a wave a plane wave

instead of being sines and cosines will

be of the form e to the I KX our K can

be positive or negative

a K being positive corresponds to a wave

moving to the right round the loop okay

moving negative K corresponds to a

going the other direction just to remind

you K is not an arbitrary number it has

to be it has to come in integer

multiples of something or other in order

that the wave when it comes back to

itself after going around the distance L

that the wave comes back to its own

original value so if we say that X and

going all the ways around I said I

wouldn't draw it but I did the distance

around this L then e to the I K L must

be what it's got to be it's got to be

one it's got to be one at x equals zero

here's x equals zero right over here

this function is one when x equals zero

any exponential of X is one and when it

goes all the ways around better come

back to itself so that means that e to

the ikx

e to the let's say I KZ ro x equals zero

x equals L e to the IKr is just 1 and

what does that mean e to the i KL equals

1 what does that say that says that K

times L must be an integer multiple of 2

pi e to the 2 pi I is equal to 1 how do

I know that well we can just work it out

remember what the exponential means it

means cosine of 2 pi plus sorry 2 pi

plus I times sine 2 pi cosine of 2 pi is

1 sine is 2 pi is 0 and so indeed this

is equal to 1 and in fact if you put any

multiple of

my dear it's also one so as long as KL

is an integer multiple of 2 pi this is a

periodic function e to the ikx is a

periodic function so K times L must be

equal to 2 pi times an integer and let's

call that integer n this integer should

be distinguished from another in which

will occur later it's the end which

counts the number of quanta of each type

all right this is not counting the

number of quanta of particles it's just

counting the allowable wave numbers this

is called the wave number and um right

so K times L is 2 n PI or K must be 2 pi

in over L that's the that's the

condition on K that when you go around

the function comes back to itself so

that's why one thing incidentally this

is exactly the same thing as the

quantization of the wavelength saying

the wavelength has to fit in an integer

multiple of times by the time you come

back what's the connection between K and

wavelength yeah

the wavelength is inverse to ke there's

a 2pi in the relationship Ella yeah um

if we turn this over it's 1 over K

equals L divided by 2 pi n

or well you can work that out I'll let

you work that out this is this is the

condition on K it is equivalent to the

condition that the wavelength be

quantized so that it just fits into the

circle and integer number of times so

this is these are the kind of ways you

can have period periodically arm if we

are talking about the waves that are

associated with some quanta then K is

related to the momenta I guess we'd

better work that out I guess we better

work out the relation between K and the

wavelength um what is the wavelength

associated with a wave like this well

it's the distance you have to move

before I eat to the AYGO K goes through

one full cycle so if I want to find out

the wave length of an object like this

the wavelength of this kind of wave I

just say that that K times X or K times

the wavelength has to be K times the

wavelength wavelength lambda has to be 2

pi or K is the same thing as 2 pi

divided by the wavelength so that's the

relation between K and wavelength when

wavelength is big K is small when

wavelength is small K is big and there's

a 2pi relating them but they're closely

related alright so that's the relation

between K and wavelength does anybody

remember the relationship between the

wavelength of a photon or anything else

and its momentum right momentum of a

particle we're making a bunch of

connections momentum of a particle

described by a given quantum mechanical

wave the momentum of a particle is equal

also to what h-bar where H divided by

lambda is that right

hmm yeah H over lambda but I can express

that in terms of H bar and then there

would be a 2 pi H bar over lambda so you

can see that up that P and K are

essentially the same thing except for a

factor of K sorry except for a fact of H

bar all right in particular momentum is

H bar times K so if I have a wave

described this is called the wave number

K is called the wave number if the wave

number and it can be positive or

negative waves moving to the left moving

to the right

corresponding to momenta going to the

left or the right so that's the basic

that's the basic wave on a circle if you

like or wave on a periodic space now for

each such kind of wave there can be

quanta quanta corresponding to particles

how do we describe that those those

quanta well we just will just describe

the number of quanta with momentum P or

equivalently the number of quanta with a

given wave number K are many quanta are

there with a given wave number K since K

is itself an integer we have to specify

an integer for each integer one of those

integers is just related to the wave

number the other integer is called the

occupation number the number of quanta

occupying that particular wave if you

like or that particular wavelength

alright so there are ins which

correspond to the quantization of

momentum but there are also ins

which correspond to the

to the number of quanta with each

momentum those are called

occupation numbers so I could write and

I will write n of K this is a different

end now n of K K is itself quantized but

in of K is the number of particles or

the number of quanta with wave number K

which in effect means with momentum P

but just remember there is a relay that

P and K happen to be related by h-bar of

course if I'm smart I choose a units in

which cable K is equal to 1 knot K is

equal to 1 H bar is equal to 1 and then

key and P are the same thing so we often

don't even bother to distinguish between

wave number and momentum we speak of K

as the momentum of the particle and K

positive yeah so you have a collection

of occupation numbers for every value of

K including negative and positive

numbers ok yeah Michael yeah hey

okay is not itself an integer wave

number is not an integer that's correct

K is two PI over L times an integer but

this integer is not the occupation

number okay we could I don't know what a

I don't know any other good notation for

integer except in unfortunately and so

everything which is quantized winds up

being called n except when it's L but I

don't want to call this thing L because

it's not L what does L L is angular

momentum which is also quantized so we

got to keep track of the two different

kinds of integers one of them the

discrete momentum and the other the

discrete number of quanta with each

momentum and the way to keep track of it

is occupation numbers I will call n of K

meaning the number of quanta with

momentum K K itself is also quantized

okay all right so occupation number

number of particles with a given

momentum k next we introduce operators

quantum mechanical operators for those

who know a little bit of quantum

mechanics you will remember that state

vectors are linear what's what should we

call them state vectors I will shoot

anybody who calls them vectors state

vectors because we will get them

confused with the directions in space

linear elements let's just call them

linear elements elements they are

elements of a vector space but they

forget to forget that the state vectors

of a system are linear elements that we

can add and so forth but we can also

operate on them with operators we've

gone through this

at least twice in this clan in this

series of classes and um the observables

of a quantum mechanical system are the

hermitian or real valued operators which

operate on the state's operate means

they are operations which change a state

into another state now what is the state

what is it what is a convenient way to

label the possible states of a system of

quanta moving on such a circle is to

specify all the end of K so you can

think of it as in one and of one and of

two with one two and so forth refer to

the values of K and of three or I should

also I also have to put an end of - 1 -

2 don't I well darn it how am I going to

do this I just have to imagine that this

string is the string goes by both to the

left end to the right and that

represents a state with n1 quanta with

the first value momentum into quanta

with the second value momentum we're not

to specify with these values of K are

just the first one second one third one

and so forth the - one - tooth so that's

a quantum state of the quanta moving on

the circle and now there are operators

analogous to not only analogous to but

really equivalent to are the harmonic

oscillator creation and annihilation

operators the raising and lowering

operators remember the harmonic

oscillator

is described by operators a plus and a

minus

I'm not multiplying now I'm just writing

them a plus in my a minus a plus

increases these are the energy levels of

the oscillator it increases takes you

from zero quanta to one quanta one

quanta the two quanta and so forth and

so on and a minus takes you back down

okay so what these operators are and

there's one of them for each momentum

are one a plus and one may a minus for

each momentum so they should be labeled

as a plus of K and a minus of K so what

does a plus of K do when it acts on a

state vector like this well it goes to

the k DH slot for example let's take a

plus of one it goes to the first slot

here and increases the number of quanta

by one unit it also does something else

you remember what the other thing it

does it multiplies by something square

root of n square root of n plus 1 hmm

yeah yeah

for the minus is just square root of n

right so I'll remind you to keep track

of those coefficients that are explained

last time and as a bookkeeping device

it's a bookkeeping device the a plus is

the the square roots alright so a plus

of 1 and in general a plus of K goes to

the caithe momentum slot I really should

call it a plus maybe of n of K where

that's going to get no no no no no

that's bad that's bad nah no just a plus

of K increases the number of quanta with

momentum K by 1 unit

and a - decreases it at the same time

multiplying by the appropriate square

root of n all right those are that's the

that's set of mathematical objects that

we have to deal with and how do we build

a quantum field what is the connection

between the quantum field and the

a-pluses in the a - is well I'll tell

you now little secret what the a pluses

in the a minuses are in another language

they're the quantum mechanical versions

of the Fourier coefficients the Fourier

coefficients of the field a field on a

periodic circle like this can be

represented let's go let's give the feel

the name let's call it Sai let's call it

Sai and Sai is a field it's a function

of X and any such field on a periodic

interval like that can be represented as

an infinite sum over the allowable

values of ke I write sum over K you say

what values of K a my summing over I'm

summing over the allowable values of K

of what coefficients let's call them

alpha of K e to the I K X that's the

same as expanding it in sines and

cosines at psy and there is another

object size star once our star

the complex conjugate of sorry obviously

psy is a in general a complex thing e to

the ikx is a complex thing if psy is a

complex thing it has a real and

imaginary part the real part plus I

times the imaginary part is psy real

part minus I times the imaginary part is

called the complex conjugate that's

equal to the sum on K of the complex

conjugate of Alpha times

what's the complex conjugate of e to the

ikx e to the minus ikx so to specify a

classical wave let's call this a

classical wave you specify all of these

Fourier coefficients these Fourier

coefficients you don't have to specify

separately the alphas in the Alpha stars

if you know alpha you know alpha star

but you do have to specify the real and

imaginary part of the alphas okay so a

classical configuration of a wave is

specified by giving the alphas the

quantum mechanical a pluses in a minuses

are the quantum mechanical versions of

the alphas these are observables why are

they observables because if you have a

wave you can measure the amplitude of

each of its Fourier components this is

the amplitudes of the Fourier components

can you measure them sure so their

observables or at least the real and

imaginary parts of them are observables

classically if you can measure the real

part and the imaginary part the whole

thing is observable but strictly

speaking when you do an observation you

get a real number so an alpha really

stands for two observables a real and

imaginary part on

the quantum mechanical version of the

alphas I'm not going to write equals

that wouldn't quite make sense these are

classical variables these are quantum

mechanical operators but instead of

writing equals let's write them I don't

know sort of equals that means

approximately equal yeah yeah back and

forth arrow that means in quantum in

quantizing the system you replace alpha

by A's so the double arrow means replace

body the same thing here alpha star yeah

do I have this right I wonder if I have

it I wonder if um I think I have it

right as we go along let me decide to

change the definition so that this is

called alpha star and that's alpha it's

not important because you you have the

freedom let's say yep I'm going to

change it you have a standard definition

and this is a convention of course if

alpha star is the congregate the outer

come up the conjugate of alpha alpha is

the conjugate of alpha star so there's a

matter of definition here that you can

choose either way but I think it's

standard if I remember to make this

identification again it's not terribly

important then you say the quantum field

the definition of the quantum field is

simply replace the alphas by the create

Shanaya Latian operators a marinus of K

a plus of K now of course of K of course

we would have to prove that in some

sense or another the classical alphas in

some appropriate limit the A's must

behave like the alphas in what sense I

can just make this replacement there on

the blackboard but you probably say to

yourself why is that the right

replacement and what since the these

quantum mechanical objects behave

anything like our like the classical

Fourier coefficients okay well in many

ways but them let's to see that we have

to go a little more into the dynamics of

quantum fields and we will we will a

little bit but let's just take it as a

matter of definition now that a quantum

field is represented as a fourier some

where the fourier coefficients are

operators that makes sense that the

fourier coefficients are operators that

make sense because a fourier

coefficients you expect to be

observables and that the structure of

those observables or the relation

between them is exactly the relation

between creation and annihilation

operators the field is now the field is

an operator right yep

and change the star and make it

hermitian conjugate

after 19 question no so my understanding

was that when quantum field theory

introduced a major breakthrough was that

it allowed for particle creation

annihilation and you use the terms

dilation creation rod that doesn't mean

that the dynamics will create an

Annihilator articles for that we have to

go into the make the dynamics of these

fields well they change the number of

particles what the A's and the a pluses

in the a minuses do is they change the

number of particles these things here

represent the number of particles with

momentum one number of particles of

momentum two number of particles of

momentum three and what the A's do is

they change now to say that the A's

change the number of particles doesn't

mean that nature goes around changing

the number of particles these are

mathematical symbols which change the

number of particles it doesn't mean that

particle number changes okay that is it

that's a matter of laws of nature where

the laws of nature permit the number of

particles to change but if the number if

the laws of nature do allow the number

of particles to change these operators

are going to be very useful in

describing those kind of changes now

there's other situations even where the

number of particles doesn't change

well it looks let's look at this let's

look at what we can do with these

operators um supposing we want to

describe a reaction where a particle

scatters a particle scatters when it

scatters let's say we have one particle

not a whole bunch of particles one

particle of a given momentum K and that

particle is going to scatter collide

with something and it's going to come

off

with another momentum how do we describe

how how might we describe such a process

we might describe a process like that by

saying let's start with the state with

one particle where shall I put that

particle in here

whatever the momentum of the particle

happens to be if the particle happens to

have momentum k7 then I will make a 0 0

I'll go to the seventh place and put a 1

there and then 0 0 0 that's supposed to

be the seventh place ok so this

describes a state with one particle of

momentum k7 whatever k7 happens to be

now I want to describe a process where

the particle of a given momentum

scatters and comes off with some

different momentum now so far we've only

been talking about one dimension of

motion we've been talking about motion

on a line ok we can do motion on a line

and we can even think of changes of

momentum a particle gets hit by

something and it's momentum changes how

can we describe that well we can

describe that by saying we can describe

that by an operator which makes exactly

those changes namely take an operator

which removes this particle what's that

that's a minus of 7

okay or a minus of K sub 7 but the a

minus of 7 that removes that particle

and then puts back another particle in

another momentum state for example if

it's a scattering where a particle goes

from momentum k 7 to k9 then we'll put

here a plus of 9:00 okay 9:00

maybe I should call it let's call it K

let's let's let's write it that way a

minus of K seven a plus of k 9 what does

this do

it acts on a state with a momentum with

K 7 and switches it the k-9 so it's a

scattering it's a kind of scattering

process or it does it does what the

scattering process well here here it

doesn't matter here the that just

multiplies by war that you operators you

have a scalar multiplier so resent

square we said into something square

root of n 7

but then 7 is 1 right then having right

so let's see what this does it first

removes this particle with a coefficient

1 so it gives a plus of K 9 times 0 0 0

0 0 0 what's what is the state called

with all zeros called the vacuum alright

so when I speak of the vacuum it is also

the ground state and also the state of

lowest energy and in this simple example

we could call it the vacuum meaning no

particles all right so the first

operator takes a state it makes the

vacuum out of it and then the second

operator comes now the creation operator

multiplies by square root of n plus 1

right all right but we go then to k9 k9

is out here its occupation number zero

so the n plus 1 is just going to give us

1 again

all right so this operation then gives

us zero zero zero zero but then out at

the ninth place it gives us a 1 so all

it's done with coefficient one is it's

switched the place where the particle is

from one momentum to another momentum

now there are if there are situations

where these square roots of n come in

and we'll talk about them we'll talk

about what they do they are important

but in this particular problem because

there was never more than one particle

in the problem it the square roots of n

don't do anything ok so here's an

example then where a scattering process

is described by a certain combination of

A's now let's let's go a little bit

further let's suppose that the laws of

physics allow for the possibility that

the number of particles is not conserved

okay

supposing one particle can come in and

two particles can go out oh this process

of course we could have described in

another way we didn't need to go to this

arm complicated story with occupation

numbers we could have just said a

particle makes a transition from one

momentum to another but now let's get a

little fancier and say the laws of

physics permit a new kind of process

where the number of particles change for

example one particle comes in it might

collide with something and two particles

of the same kind go out but two

particles with different momenta

particle of K one comes in and two

particles one of K three and one of K

five go out don't worry too much about

momentum conservation I'm assuming

there's something to soak up the recoil

some other object how would we describe

that

that would be difficult to describe in

one particle quantum mechanics one

particle quantum mechanics means the

quantum mechanics of a single particle

this was this is possible to describe it

was never more than one particle 1

particle went to one particle but one

particle goes to 2 particles that you

can't describe in single particle

quantum mechanics but you can describe

it here again you remove ok the seventh

particle and you put in the ninth

particle and you also put in the

eleventh particle I don't know why I'm

taking only odd numbers let's put it an

even number a plus of 16 of K 16 so this

is a process where a particle of

momentum K 7 comes in may collide with

something one might say that that

something absorbs the particles just

language this is language the target

whatever it was absorbed this particle

and emitted two particles one of K 9 and

one of K 16 so this gives you

flexibility this the existence of these

operators and this space of states in

which the number of particles is

variable that gives you flexibility in

studying processes with a particle

number can change people cooking number

there

chocolate chip operator all right so if

a + creates a particle of momentum K a +

of K what does psy of X do sine of X is

also an operator it's a sum of operators

or let's take side dagger side dagger is

made up out of creation operators it

creates a particle of momentum K no

sorry 8 + create some particle of

momentum K what does I do so to

understand that you have to remember

that in quantum mechanics unlike

classical mechanics you get to add

States States form a linear I'm going to

say at a linear vector space that only

means that you can add them subtract

them and multiply them by ordinary

numbers all right so let's start with

the vacuum I'll just I'm not going to

write a string of zeros Oh stand for

oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

okay and now we act with side dagger

first of what a side do incidentally

side tries to annihilate a particle but

there's no particle led to annihilate so

it just gives you zero no state at all

but let's take the creation of the

creation object side plus and act on

this I all we have to do now is follow

our nose sy plus of X where X is some

particular core value of position some

specific value of position let's see

what it does

yeah sigh dagger well we just substitute

the sigh we're at some of a K of a + of

K Oh times e to the I KX minus ikx but

what is this object here this is an

object which just represents one

particle with momentum K I didn't take

it outside

good point some e to the minus ikx

this is a one particle state with

momentum K what happens if i superpose

one-particle states with momentum k with

a set of coefficients e to the minus ikx

does anybody remember from quantum

mechanics what happens if you superpose

or add up state vectors corresponding to

a particle of momentum K and you add

them up with coefficience e to the minus

ikx

anybody remember no kazar momentum

states you got the right idea but you

wanted to

hmm these are momentum states this is a

momentum state what happens if you thin

doesn't take the operator this is a

momentum state we if we were doing one

particle quantum mechanics we might just

call this a particle of momentum ke one

particle alright in this in this problem

here I never have more than one particle

I act with this operator it gives me a

superposition of one particle States

each state that appears here is a one

particle state and it's a one particle

state with momentum K and I'm told to

add them up with e to the minus ikx it's

a position state it's a state with a

definite position what's the position X

right if you add up momentum states

within e to the ikx that gives you a

position stay as state located at

position X that's one particle quantum

mechanics so that tells us then what

side dagger of X does side dagger of X

creates a particle at position X it

creates a sum of particles it creates a

coherent quantum mechanical

superposition of States with momentum

momentum all the allowed momenta all

with coefficient e to the minus ikx

incidentally what's the probability for

different values of K

all the different values of K have the

same probability because the coefficient

here when squared all give one so this

is a linear superposition of states with

different momenta where the probability

remember what the probability is the

probability would just be the square of

this the square of this tile or it times

its complex conjugate this would be just

a state with a uniform probability in

momentum space all right but it is a

state with a definite with a particle at

a definite position okay so this is

getting pretty now sigh and the a pluses

of K and a minuses of K which are the

Fourier which ought to be interpreted as

the Fourier decomposition of psy of X

those are creation and annihilation

operators for particles with definite

momentum sigh of X and side Eiger of X

are creation and annihilation operators

for particles of definite position so if

you wanted to create a particle at

position X you would not do it with a of

K but you would do it instead with side

dagger of X which you can rewrite in

terms of A's of K but it's just giving

you the quantum mechanical superposition

of momentum states that adds up to a

position state okay that's the basic

idea of a quantum field uh when once the

in relativity it's a little more

complicated but if we don't worry about

the complications of a special theory of

relativity don't worry about them yet

then the quantum field side dagger of X

is a creation operator for a particle at

position

yeah in this case in this case this

spawn it it is a spot on that circle

yeah it's a spot on that circle now

eventually right eventually we can make

the circle bigger and bigger and bigger

what does that do

remember the allowable values of K were

2 pi integer over L okay so they're

spaced they're spaced by a spacing 2 PI

over L that's the spacing as L gets

bigger and bigger the spacing gets

smaller and smaller and eventually you

can have essentially any value of K or

at least for any value of K there's a

state arbitrarily close by so making

making the ring bigger and bigger and

bigger is equivalent to replacing the

discrete values of the momenta by

continuous values and what does that

entail for an equation like this right

it means that you integrate over K

instead of summing over K but it's good

the first time around to think about it

discreetly once you know when you

understand that you can replace it by

integral DK but let's not do that yet ok

next step next question what if sy

creates a particle at position X

obviously side dagger no no I take the

packet side agar creates a particle at

position X what does sy do

annihilates a particle at X right okay

let's think let's think now about the

possible kinds of reactions reactions I

now mean particle reactions that we

could think about but in the language of

sigh of X let's let's here's a possible

reaction you tell me if this is if you

think this is a likely thing a particle

comes in and when it hits a target where

the target happens to be localized very

precisely localized at position X that

particle disappears and then off on

Alpha Centauri somewhere as a particle

goes off here you know and somewhere is

on Betelgeuse another one goes off over

here that sound likely doesn't sound

likely it's what we would call non-local

it violates the rules that that signals

can propagate the arbitrary kind of

crazy velocities what what's the right

thing to think about the right thing to

think about if you want to preserve in

your theory very precise notion of

locality is that up off particle is

absorbed right over here and then two

particles are emitted the emitted

particles will be absorbed will be

emitted from the same spot now you might

want to loosen that up a little bit for

one reason or another and say well maybe

it only means if they were but they're

admitted within a certain region of that

but in fact the precise notion of

locality in quantum field theory is that

when a reaction happens it happens very

much at a spot like this so how would we

describe this reaction one particle

comes in is absorbed at X two particles

go out are emitted from the same point

we could use these operators to describe

more non-local processes but if we want

this local process what do we write we

write that a particle that the first

thing that happens is a particle is

removed from the system that's I at

point X and then two particles are put

back in at position X that would be side

dagger of X side dagger of X that might

act on a state with some sorry not not

the vacuum state but a state with

someone put with a particle in it

anything with some particle in it let's

try to figure out here's the exercise a

particle with momentum K comes in I want

to know if that particle with momentum K

is absorbed at position X what is the

final state what is the final state and

what is the various probabilities for

this final state to have this or that

momentum so what we have to do is very

simple in fact we have to first of all

say there's a particle with momentum K

here that means 0 0 0 and in the case

slot there's one particle that's the

first step write down the initial state

step number one step number two

substitute for these local these are

called local field operators because

they're localized at a position

substitute their expression if we're

trying to find out information about

momentum substitute in their expression

in terms of

momentum creation and annihilation

operators so let's do that okay so I of

X first of all is sum over K and again

some of it K means sum over the

allowable values of K a minus of K e to

the I K X that's sine of X what x do I

put in here the X at which the reaction

is happening all right so what kind of

what kind of action could we imagine can

you give me an example that would make

some sense well let's not talk

abstractly let's talk concretely

yeah we could have okay so then we will

have to have operators describing

different kinds of particles right no

but I mean you you've got the right idea

but let's use photons now this is not

quite the right description of photons

but let's ignore the photons are

relativistic particles this is more

appropriate than nonrelativistic

particles that's it let's ignore that

all right so a photon comes in hits an

atom localized at a point and from that

point two photons go off okay all right

so the first photon is the first is the

photon which we put into the system to

begin with what what comes next

all right so we take this field operator

that's the field operator which absorbs

a particle at position X and we allow it

to strike this initial state zero blah

blah blah one zero zero zero in the case

in the K place over here now this is a

sum of K this K is different than this K

and one what sense is this caitiff

this K here was summing this is a dummy

index just a summation index this is

some definite K let's call it K initial

the initial momentum of the particle

okay but our that that's the first step

then once we work that out we'll have to

hit it with side dagger of x times side

dagger of X and here's side dagger of X

so let's write that down since K is a

summation index we should use a

different letter we shouldn't use K over

again let's call it L these are

summation variables doesn't matter what

you call them I just don't want to

repeat the use of a summation variable

over here and call it the same thing

again so we have summation for the first

operator summation over L a plus of L e

to the I L X that's this are e to the

minus re election and what about the

second application of sigh of side

dagger we just have to write the same

thing again but again we better use a

different summation index because we're

not allowed to repeat the use of a

summation index twice that wouldn't make

sense we would mean so we have to repeat

same thing what should we call the new

summation index K L M our em doesn't

mean nasiha all rights wave number M a

plus of L e to the minus i ôm sorry m e

to the I minus I MX

all right what kind of state does this

create let's see what kind of state it

creates first of all here's a big sum

which terms of this sum give something

which is not equal to zero what case of

I only if this K here is not the same as

this K for example if this is K sub

thirteen that corresponds to the

thirteenth slot then what happens when I

apply K 1 e to the minus I K 1 well it

tries to absorb the first particle but

there is no first particle same for the

second once and only the 13th slot is

occupied so only K sub 13 will survive

or a sub 13 will survive when it hits

the state the rule is an annihilation

operator has to find something to

annihilate so this really reduces to one

term its summation not science not

summation one term and it's the term

with a minus of K 13 ok initial just K

initial K initial times e to the I K

initial X acting on this state 1 now

what does this do what does the

annihilation operator do when it hits

the state it just removes that particle

with a coefficient of 1 so it just we

just erase it and erase the particle and

all that's left is a state with no

particles times e to the I K in itial X

but now we have to apply this we have to

create particles

summation L well just be exactly the

summation that we have here this part of

it were finished with and it just gave

us an e to the I K initial x times the

vacuum okay now what do these do what

does this one do first it puts in a

particle of momentum L okay so it puts

in a particle of momentum L that's what

each other that's what a plus of L does

and what does this one do it puts in a

particle of momentum M so the whole

thing in the end is we keep that e to

the I Kayne itial X e to the minus I MX

e to the minus I LX x 0 0 but now when 1

0 0 1 0 whatever summed over Ln M which

ones which two sites are occupied ln m

ln m so what it's given me there's a sum

over ln m and now let's just replace

this let's just call this a two particle

state with a particle of momentum L and

a particle of momentum in the notation

is now I've used a different notation

I'm labeling this now as two particles

one with momentum L and one moment 'm m

and it's a sum over such states the sum

has not gone away but it's a sum over L

and M

with a coefficient with with a with a

functional dependence e to the I k1 X

minus MX minus LX all together summon ml

e to the I K in the show minus M minus L

x times L M yeah yeah the two creation

operators commute creation operators

commute okay that's a very good question

the rule is all creation operators

commute with each other all annihilation

operators commute with each other and

creation and annihilation operators

commute if they refer to different

momenta okay if they refer to if they

refer to the same momenta then they

don't commute

sit again ah for the speck good good

point good good good

okay right this is correct if M does not

equal L what is this this is what is the

probability for different values of L

and M coming from here no no no no

conservation momentum here because the

atom which absorbs the photon could

recoil right so the heavy atom could

absorb any amount of momentum all right

so there's no conservation of momentum

what this is up here is the change in

momentum initial momentum minus final

momentum it is of course the end the

momentum carried away by the atom all

right but this function here which is a

function of M and L is just a phase it's

magnitude is 1 so that means there are

equal probabilities for all values of L

and M when you square it the the wave

the you can think of this as the wave

function for a two particle State the

wave function is a pure phase and all

values of the momenta have equal

probability okay except not quite what

about if l equals m then i made a

mistake and the reason that I made a

mistake is when all right so let's go to

that particular case let's take one

particular case where L and M are the

same of course there are many many such

cases L could be a M could be anything

but I want to focus on those

contributions where the two where the L

and the M are the same alright this is

going to be the senator the factor e to

the 2i m

X on e to the minus 2i MX that's just

because L and M are the same so they'll

be the same factor of the same kind of

factor there but one thing will be new

what is it what happens when a plus ax

the first time

it gives me it gives me a particle and

the emphasize what happens if a plus ax

again no no it has the same momentum it

creates another particle but it gives me

a square root of 2 right it gives me a

square root of 2 after the first one

acted now I take the second one it looks

for a particle of momentum N and it

finds one damn it it finds one so

there's one particle present already

remember the rule is that if it finds n

particles here you give it a square root

of n square root of n plus 1 square root

of n plus 1 so what's the square root of

n plus 1 square root of 2

they have to be off by impossible LLL be

off by one no because I made it

impossible one worker if the a + n if

you're straight n plus 1 n plus don't

confuse particle number with momentum

number right right okay right so right

so for the special case where L and M

with the two particles come out with the

same momentum does it it could be that

momentum it could be that momentum it

could be that momentum if they come out

with the same momentum there's a factor

of square root of 2 what does it mean

about probabilities ya u square u square

these you square the coefficients of the

state vectors to find probability that's

odd if two particles go off in arbitrary

directions not the same with different

momenta or different momenta different

magnitudes of momenta there's one value

of the probability but if you produce

two particles with the same momentum

then the probability is twice as large

these particles like to be in the same

state these are in oh these are sorry

these are this is the description of

indistinguishable particles right this

is very much that this is the

description of particles which are not

distinguishable from each other so the

production of two photons in a collision

is twice as probable if the two photons

come off in the same state as if they

came off in different states

it tooks about the operators you're in a

complex we are but if you got in titled

economics and particles being generated

is it obvious

oh no it's not obvious what order but

with different orders you can always

commute them until they come out in the

order in which all the annihilation

operators are to the right and all the

creation operators up to the left that's

called normal ordering and in that

ordering the first thing you do is you

let the operators eat particles and then

spit out some new ones so normal

ordering but we'll come to that our old

saying there is like zero or bird s

person what's twice that okay that that

that is a good question but for that I

ask you to keep in mind the example in

which the moment' are quantized

for example the mud these could be

photons in a in a cavity where the

momenta really are quantized okay so if

if a particle and a cavity where the

momenta are quantized of a particle

photon comes in hits an atom and creates

two photons it will be twice as probable

for the two photons to be in the same

discrete energy level as to be in

different levels

it seems to me that there's there's only

one case where L equals M equals three

so here only one case that comes up in

the Sun where L equals M equals three

but there are two cases where one of L

and M is 2 and the other is 3 in other

words it LM are different then they show

up twice in the Sun okay so what let's

see um yeah you're right so let's see

what that says let's see

if L and M are different okay good good

good so let's do that case that's going

to give you a what kind of factor then

right you want your right so let's see

so what so if we have a of - a dagger of

- a dagger of three we have to add to

that plus a dagger of three a dagger of

- that's true so it looks like this one

is more probable but it's not as much

more probable as it would be if that

square root of two was with that so

let's okay so let me give you another

example where you really see this is

yeah I actually think you're right that

the that the ones with different

momentum because there are two different

ways to do it maybe more probable but

let me give you another example where

you can see the square roots of N in

action supposing we have a particle

which can decay so we have some sort of

particle which can decay and emit a

photon how do we describe that we

typically describe that by just one a

sigh of X suppose it can emit one photo

now let's see what yeah one photon one

photon is enough one photon is enough

all we want to do is create a photon at

point x let's create a photon at point X

all right so that's just side dagger of

X

acting on the vacuum this would be that

the K of an object producing a photon or

just the emission of a photon from a

point X what does this give this gives

some over momenta K creation operator of

momentum K e to the minus a plus e to

the minus I KX acting on the vacuum

vacuum means the state with no photons

in it for example all right what does

this give this gives the sum over K e to

the minus I KX times a state with a

particle of momentum K obviously equal

probability for all possible momenta k

in this particular case okay

equal probability for all moment the k

now let me do something else let me

suppose that there was pre-existing a

particle of momentum l that was

pre-existing in the cavity there was a

particle of momentum l and our atom

decays as an atom it's going to decay in

emitted photon but there's already a

pre-existing photon of momentum L the

first calculation told us that in the

simple model situation we have equal

probabilities for the emission of all

possible moment' that don't worry about

conservation laws here we've abandoned

them a while back tells us that there's

nothing distinctive about any of the

moment' that they all have equal

probabilities of being emitted but now

let's suppose there's already a

pre-existing particle of momentum L then

that means we have to operate on this

here with a particle that already has

momentum L in it there's a one here

someplace

okay supposing K is not this is the elf

place over here

supposing K is not equal to L then this

just creates a particle of momentum K

with no square roots of anything because

it looked for it created a particle of K

where there was no particle of ke

so the square root of n is just square

root of 1 and what does it do it creates

a state with an e to the minus ikx times

K and L the else particle is still there

and the new particle is K but now

supposing we look for the term in this

sum where K is equal to L then what do

we get then we get a square root of 2

then we get a square root of 2 so this

is correct as long as K is not equal to

L we get a state with two particles with

a wave function e to the minus ikx the

original elf particle is still Leia was

just a bystander and a particle of

momentum K was emitted it was emitted

with an amplitude e to the minus ikx a

quantum mechanical amplitude e to the

minus ikx

but what about the possibility that K

here is equal to L then what happens

by a factor of two by a factor of two

because now this a of K is a of L that

term is just a of L there's already a

particle there of momentum L and so you

get square root of 2 that's what these

operators do that's what these things do

they give you fact as the square root of

the number of particles of the type each

time one of these things acts so if

there was particles all over the place

here then you would have an enhanced

probability for producing particles of a

kind which already there yes that's

called that's called yes this is called

stimulated emission stimulated the did

particle l has to be is the same

location already this if you have a same

momentum in this case under the same

okay can't you both in the same position

and Z so it can be like yellow one mile

away

well really particles come out in wave

packets they don't really come out in

the street our momentum eigenstates but

in a cavity in a cavity they come out

with definite momenta and and this is a

real effect this is a real effect that

if there are particles present of

filling the cavity then the decay will

preferentially happen in two photons

which which have the momentum of the

particles in the cavity the more

particles you have in the cavity of a

given momentum the more probable it is

that the next particle will come out

with that momentum so if instead of

having one particle in this else slot we

had a hundred particles in this l slot

then we would get a factor of square

root of 101 I guess yeah square root of

101

and the probability would be 101 times

larger that the atom decays into the

state photon with the same momentum is

that 101 particles okay so you can

figure out more generally what the

answer will be

that's called stimulated emission and

what it means is that just the presence

of particles of a given type will

increase the probability that our decay

takes place but only when the decay

takes place with the final momentum

being the same little bit earlier so so

I gather the two new particles is still

preferred a different

yeah but not as a run but not as much as

if that extra square root too wasn't

there but then they will be attracted to

yeah it's not a real legitimate

attraction of any kind it's a

statistical effect it's there it's the

effect of identity identity of particles

now particles not all particles have

this same tendency incidentally

particles come in two kinds there are

fermions and bosons bosons are particles

described as I described them here

creation and annihilation operators with

the mathematics of the creation and

annihilation operators being the

mathematics of harmonic oscillators

particular square roots of n with the

creation and annihilation operators

having the algebraic commutation

relations of harmonic oscillators ah

then you have this tendency this is very

very general tendency that the more

particles you have the more likely it is

you will decay or produce particles of

the same momentum same thing happens in

scattering reactions if you have a

scattering reaction and it then it tends

to make particles of different momenta

if you already have moment' the present

of a certain kind it will tend to

preferentially cause the products of

collision to come out with the momentum

of the particles there incidentally I

said it's called stimulated emission

when a particle when a atom decays in

the presence of already pre-existing

photons that enhances the probability

for it to decay when there are no

photons present then adjust the k's with

the probability no will deal with the

coefficient one that's spontaneous

emission so spontaneous emission is the

emission which is unaffected by

additional particles because there are

no additional

articles spontaneous emission

stimulated emission is the tendency for

other particles to stimulate the

emission and have make it happen with a

higher probability there is a classical

analog of this incidentally um if you

have an atom which is radiating even

just classically and you have an

electromagnetic wave passing by it the

electromagnetic wave will vibrate the

will shake the electrons and cause them

to radiate with a higher probability

than they would have radiated or faster

radiate faster than they would have

radiated without that electromagnetic

wave going past and in fact it will tend

to make the emitted electromagnetic wave

come out with the same direction same

moment the same wave number so it really

is a quantum mechanical version of

something that was known classically

namely just that a pre-existing wave

will excite the system to to radiate

more just because pre-existing wave will

vibrate the electrons okay particles of

this type which have the tendency to

come out in the same state particles

that they don't really attract it's not

that they attract that so that would be

a wrong language but which have the

statistical probability because of the

square roots of n2 like to be in the

same state those are called bosons

they're characterized by creation and

annihilation operators let's write down

the mathematical rules

there's mathematical rules of bosons

for each momentum there are creation and

annihilation operators the creation and

annihilation operators have the property

that all creation operators for any

momenta commute so a + of K times a + of

L is the same thing as a plus of L times

a plus of K that's true if K equals L or

K bar or K doesn't equal L same thing

with the annihilation operators but an

annihilation operator with a creation

operator they do not commute now

remember what we found for the harmonic

oscillator when we did it just one

oscillator a - with a plus we got one

one alright this is one if K equals L

and 0 otherwise so the rule is they

always commute if we're talking about

different momenta if we're talking about

the same momenta than an annihilation

operator and a creation operator do not

commute but have a one on the right hand

side we can write that in the form Delta

K L where Delta KL is the Kronecker

Delta the symbol which is 1 if K equals

L and 0 otherwise this together Delta KL

together with the definition

the sigh of X is equal sum of I guess a

minus of K is it e to the plus or each

other - what could I have written I

think e to the minus ikx if I can

remember correctly with that definition

this basically defines the simplest

quantum field theory psy is a quantum

field and its job is to create and

annihilate particles one more one more

thing about bosons before we go on to

fermions fermions are kind of particle

which are different obviously otherwise

they wouldn't have another name one more

thing about bosons let's look at side

dagger of X sine of X integrated over

all space what is that object now I know

what that object is I wouldn't have

written it down if I didn't know what it

was but let's work it out let's pretend

we didn't know what it was and see if we

can work out what it is

sigh our quantum mechanical operators

this is an observable ok let's work it

out it's equal from the definition of sy

into the saw let's see some oh I think I

want R that's right sum of a plus of K

there it's each of our ikx I keep

getting confused about the pluses and

minuses I'll probably make mistakes

that's sigh of X at side dagger of X

what about sy of X

hmm oh it's a - Greta ah - it wouldn't

make any difference for this calculation

that's right the power and some balance

of yes it is it is it is okay so this is

some of a k then there's another one

which is sum over L which is the

annihilation operator a - of L e to the

plus I LX and this gets integrated over

X now let's see if we can examine what

that quantity is this is integral DX the

only X dependence here is in these

coefficient functions all right so what

we really need to know is what the

integral e to the I LX e to the i L

minus K X DX is that's the integral that

appears here e to the I LX e to the

minus ikx that's this integrated the X

that's the integration that appears here

what do we integrate we integrate over

all of space which means over this

circle of length L so what do we get if

we integrate this over a circle of my

well supposing first of all k is equal

to L naught 2 pi just L just their home

so you get L if K is equal to L what if

K is not equal to L it's 0 why because

it because this will be sines and

cosines and if you integrate a sine and

a cosine around the close around the you

know an integer multiple of wavelengths

you get 0 both sines and cosines are

positive as much as they are negative so

what is this thing this is Delta KL

times the length of the times the length

of the interval all right so that means

when we do this integral it's going to

pick out only the terms where K and L

are equal that's what this means it's

going to give us a factor of big L so it

gives us L times the sum over K but now

it's a single sum and not a double sum

because K has to be equal to L and

what's it going to be it's going to be a

plus of K a minus of K do you remember

for the harmonic oscillator with a plus

times a minus was the occupation number

a plus times a minus is the occupation

number is the number of quanta with

momentum K go back to your notes a plus

times a minus if you work out all the

square roots of ends and things a plus

times a minus acting on any state just

gives you the same thing as the

occupation number so a plus times a

minus is the occupation number the

number of particles with momentum K what

if you sum that over K

total number particles hey yeah let's

say it just counts the number of

particles total number of particles so

this object here if I divide it by L I

have to provide it by L because of this

L which appears here that is equal to

the number of particles total number of

particles now there are conventions

where you absorb this L into sy and

there's a more normal canal I have been

following a particular set of

conventions it's led me to have this one

over L out here that's alright we can

leave it there but basically size star

times I is accounting quantity it counts

the number of particles its observable

it's a quantum mechanical operator but

all it is is the number of particles

number of particles may or may not be

conserved so in general this integral

can change with time

if particles are absorbed in annihilator

are absorbed it all created on the other

hand if the number of particles was

conserved then this is a conserved

quantity so this is the thing which

counts the number of particles are apart

from this l would you give a name to sy

start on the sides are the Institut you

could call it the number of particles

appoint X but that's not such a good

idea because you know the density of

particles at X right so that's apart

from a factor of L which I will ignore

just uh

it'll go away when we play sums over

kaze by integrals over K but apart from

a factor K psystar psy let's just say

psystar psy is proportional to equals

the density of particles at X sorry sine

of X sine of X and it's a quantum

mechanical operator so that's it that is

the simplest of all quantum field

theories a boson ik quantum field theory

where the fields are made up out of

creation in both an i elation operators

there's a sigh there is a sighs star and

you can work out incidentally it's fun

to work out the commutation relations

between sigh of X and size star of X we

know the commutation relations of the

A's the sighs are built out of the A's

it's interesting to work out the

commutation relations of the size okay

so that the move on a little bit like I

got yellow that's the density of

particles of X now as I said this this

whole machinery so far assumes there is

one species of identical particles

identicals means they're all the same

kind they're identical except for the

fact that they might have different

momenta or different position but you

wouldn't want to build into a single

quantum field both electrons and photons

this might be the field for photons now

because because of relativity we have to

modify it a little bit this would not be

the field of electrons because electrons

are not bosons and they and they have to

be dealt with differently okay that's

that's a that's the basic theory of

bosons they are described by harmonic

oscillator creation and annihilation

operators

which are the Fourier coefficients of

the field they like the in some

statistical sense they'd like to come

out in the same state if they're already

particles present that will enhance the

rate of production of particles with the

same momentum and the creation and

annihilation operators have definite

algebraic properties commutation

relations which I've left listed here

that's it that's the whole theory of a

very simple quantum field again I

emphasize that you can use it to

describe reactions with particles are

created yeah everything's

one-dimensional now but that's the bad

this that can be immediately changes by

putting in more X's right there's

nothing special about that

I see people there are some people have

to go and I don't want to start a new

subject where are people going but

perhaps so we can spend a little while

talking about something dumb whatever

you want to talk about which is not not

a linear progression

oh I see

well transparency in the transparency is

simply interference you can have a thing

which is transparent to electrons you

can have a thing which is transparent to

okay so what are the things in nature of

bosons lots of things Higgs boson is a

boson the expose on the why well lots of

things are bosons gravitons of bosons

um I what is we say that sigh or sigh

dagger and so forth is an observable

that means that the field sigh is kind

of like the electromagnetic field you

can observe it you can do an experiment

and measure side when the sigh be hey

vly CAC lassika thing now there's a

problem about measuring sigh its

components don't commute with each other

it's real and imaginary parts don't

commute with each other and you can't

simultaneously measure two non commuting

things

alright so science i dagger don't

commute that means the real and

imaginary parts of side aren't commute

how can you measure sigh if the real and

imaginary parts don't commit and answer

is you can't

you cannot you also can't measure X and

P at the same time what is it or for

that matter the harmonic oscillator

variables a and a dagger or a even a you

can't measure because it has to none

commuting a real and imaginary part what

is the situation let's take the harmonic

oscillator first in which um the

harmonic oscillator variables behave

classically and an approximate sense you

can measure

both a and a dagger or for an ordinary

young well what was the situation when

the oscillator is highly excited when

the oscillator is highly excited and

that's the situation in which the number

of excitations a times a dagger is much

much larger than h-bar is much much

larger than the right hand side of the

commutation relations you can't

precisely measure these things

simultaneously but just in the same

sense that you can measure X and P

approximately as long as you don't

violate the uncertainty principle you

can measure the components of fields

approximately as long as you don't

violate certain uncertainty principles

well what is that in the practice mean

it in practice means that you can

measure these things as long as the

degree of excitation as long as the

field strengths are large by comparison

with the uncertainties large by

comparison with the obstruction and

measuring them both simultaneously what

does it mean in terms of photons it

means lots of photons right when that's

right when you have a sufficiently large

number of photons then approximately you

can measure the the different components

of the field simultaneously within

certain errors but those errors may be a

lot smaller than the magnitudes of the

fields themselves so the observable

quantum fields thought of as things that

you can measure sigh and so forth those

behave like classical fields when the

number of quanta is very large it makes

sense when the number of quanta is very

large the field sigh behaves as if it

were a classical wave field it's only

when the number of quanta is small

you see their discreteness and that's

when psy does not behave like a

classical field anymore okay so that's

the that's the setup psy has a quantum

mechanical operator which does behave

classically under certain conditions it

is a measurable quantity or at least

parts some components of it are

measurable and it can be approximately

measured all of its components

simultaneously as long as the number of

photons is much larger than the

uncertainties dictated by the

uncertainty principle this is an

uncertainty principle it tells you that

the components of a and a dagger the

real and imaginary parts can't be

simultaneously measured yeah here's the

point a times a dagger a dagger a is the

number of particles that means roughly

speaking the magnitude of a is like the

square root of the number of particles

as long as a is much bigger than the

right hand side here as long as a times

a dagger is much bigger than the right

hand side the right hand side can

largely be ignored for many purposes and

that's the situation where our a behaves

approximately classically okay any other

questions

yeah is that can the the industry in the

initial stage of the final state that

that you started with as long as as long

as the number of partners we change

you know if you go in the other

direction which is going you stand up

with a state of zero zero zero zero the

ground state that's a highly portable

state well supposing you apply a

destruction operator to that state yeah

I thought I heard you say that to forget

no state we got zero if we could get the

lowest state with no particles in it

again no state you have to distinguish

now good the state zero is a state with

no particles in it it is not the same as

the state zero all right this this label

this state is the ground state of a

harmonic oscillator it's norm is one

it's not the zero state the zero state

is OH - oh it's it's just this is just a

vector which I've labeled as oh it is

not the zero vector in a vector space

it's the vector describing no particles

that's different than the zero vector

very different very very different zero

vector is no vector at all it doesn't

describe anything ah this is a perfectly

good normalized vector describing no

particles for the ground States

it seems like there are two states one

or two kinds of states

what is the fear that's not a state

that's a that's an operator field is not

a state it's an operator today yeah in

quantum field theory fields or operators

okay so that's not a state and we have

something which is a safe way out

I'm not reality with regular model

periodic and try to apply it to the real

world like you can say that they can't

focus on the life size of the universe

but it's not very useful oh how do you

use it in practice like the size of

cavity or whether you use well a more

common situation is when you have a

cavity with reflecting walls okay so

that's a common situation but you could

imagine electrons moving around on a

wire on a closed wire that would be an

example

the L influence the number of possible

states together putting a limit on Jake

l yeah defines the number of possible

state putting a limit on Big L know it

doesn't know it doesn't it does it

doesn't put a limit on the number of

states what it says is that K the

allowable values of K have to be two PI

over L times n and n can be any integer

what it does is it limits the number of

states with momentum below a certain

momentum so if you were to say the

largest momentum I'll ever want to think

about is well as some large amount of

momentum I never want to allow more

momentum than that then this would limit

the number of states but as long as you

can have arbitrarily high momentum so

that n can be arbitrarily large it

doesn't limit the number of states where

we started to exit T and drive me

- that's right it will be over here we

have be struck with the A+ name -

religion your value K well that responds

to the X of P in our case okay good

the X and P are right that's the real

and imaginary parts of the field in

other words the field psy one piece of

it has a pluses and the other piece has

a minuses I use this equal just you know

what I mean all right if you add oh

sorry side that guy plus if you add side

to side dagger of course you get the

real part of sorry and that's a plus

plus a minus

that's like X or maybe it's like P that

some room feels the real and imaginary

parts are the two conjugate variables

and they're the two variables the real

and imaginary part are the two variables

which have a distinct uncertainty

relation between them so side plus side

dagger plus sign side dagger plus or

minus I are two distinct objects that

the real and the imaginary part of sorry

and they correspond to the X and P of

the oscillator that's a good question

and that is question for in theory we're

actually going to have an infinite

number loops representing three space in

reality is it's three dimensional space

or shorter space yeah right we're gonna

try to

yeah no no what will you do for

three-dimensional space let's start with

two-dimensional space okay for

two-dimensional space what you would

imagine the analog of the circle is the

Taurus the Taurus the Taurus you usually

think of the Taurus is it doughnut or

the surface of the doughnut but from a

measurement from mathematicians point of

view what a Taurus is is you take a

rectangle in space and you identify the

left edge with the right edge and the

bottom edge with the top edge you can

think of it as first cutting the torus

imagine cutting the torus like that of

course we're talking about the surface

of the torus whoo-hoo ask me yeah all

right so we take the surface of the

torus and we lay it out what happens if

we cut the torus through and sort of

open it up well we get a piece of a

cylinder right and now we cut it that

but we remember that this edge is to be

identified with that edge then we slice

it through here and open it up but

remember that the top edge has to be

identified with the bottom edge so a

torus is a rectangle in which we

remember that this point is the same as

this point this point is the same as

this point and for example if we were

talking about a classical particle a

classical particle which left the torus

over here would reappear over here it

will come here it will reappear down

here that's the same as a classical

particle just moving around on the torus

it's got two directions of periodicity

and for this object both components of

the momentum the X and the y components

of momentum would be quantized so that's

the way to think about a torus as a

rectangle with periodic identifications

or with identifications across the

and of course if we had a field we would

require the field at this position to be

the same as the field at this position

the field at that point to be the same

as a field that that's it Alberto is

asking young represents space if you

represent the outdoors in space

you represent space or the object of

space yeah we're talking about space but

the only reason for making it periodic

is to avoid questions of infinity and

and eventually will will will make the

space infinite by replacing sums by

integrals incidentally there's a notion

of a three-dimensional torus a

three-dimensional torus is just a cube

with identifications this point is

identified well you know you just

identified this face is identified with

that face the top is identified with the

bottom and the front is identified with

the back so Tauruses can tour I can

exist in any dimensions and the notion

of a periodic

particle moving in periodic space is

just the notion of a particle moving

within the interior of a cube but in

such a way that when it reaches the edge

of the torus or the Reg of the cube it

reappears at the opposite oxen and

bloomie goes goodbye

space into its periodic representation

is there one that ones you here we

haven't specified anything that

statistically ality is one chosen by

everybody when they go to winter one

what road is is a a quantum a true

physical quantum jozin one day you know

number Quantico quanta are the particles

cuantos I'll put the can change they

come and they go they're created or

annihilated they're radiated in size

well that of course is a very very

speculative question my own answer would

probably be no but I think you're you're

asking

probably questions about length scales

of plunky in size and so forth and ah

that's way beyond what we're talking

about here so most likely quantum field

theory just breaks down by the time you

get to such scales it just probably

doesn't make sense

so that's where we're talking about

situations

um of let's say modest length scales

scales of ten to the minus thirteen

centimeters ten to the minus xx

centimeter centimeters 10 to the minus

twenty eight centimeters but not 10 to

the minus 33 centimeters where that is

and so but the math itself abstracted is

just annoying

all right but you know for almost all

practical purposes the to take space to

be continuous rather than the screen

incidentally its momentum which was

discrete not space when we put things on

a circle

it was the momenta the k's which were

discrete not the positions of particles

positions of particles were periodic the

momenta was speed the more these people

because we curiosity but we assume the

wave function was periodic yep yeah but

it comes back to itself after yeah now

you can question that and in fact the is

legitimate to question it but in the

simplest quantum field theory

sparking commutation relation between

the knowledge the radio operator and

change it to prior to this - development

kale is that a simple throw neon theory

register if you replace commentators by

anti commutator so commutator of a and B

is a B - BAE

so yeah that's equal to the commutator

of a with B and it's anti-symmetric and

that if you interchange a and b it

changes sign the anti commutator is by

definition and it's usually written this

way a B it's a B plus B a now I save

this for last because it's harder to

swallow that a B doesn't be that a B

plus B a equals zero that's harder to

swallow than a B minus B a is equal to

zero here we have I mean here we have

almost everything is normal a plus times

a minus is the same as a - I'm sorry

eight plus times a plus is the same as a

plus times a plus in the opposite

direction it's only a small subset of

things which are odd okay if we were to

replace this by anti commutator 's

almost everything would be odd a B plus

BA would equal zero for almost all of

them all of the time so we'll come to

that but such mathematical manipulations

define fermions and fermions are exactly

the particles that have a poly exclusion

principle you simply can't put two of

them into this not only do they not like

to be in the same state they can't be in

the same state there there's a complete

opposite to the notion of stimulated

emission if you have a Fermi on in a box

and you try

create another one with the same

momentum or same everything you can't

you can only put one of them in the

state and that has to be reflected

somehow by the algebra of the creation

and annihilation operators there are

creation and annihilation operators for

fermions but they're such that the

algebra instead of telling you that

they'd like to come out in the same

state tells you they cannot come out in

the same state so that's a yeah and if

you can't put a lot of them in the same

state it never behaves classically our

goal is our main fermions it's weird if

you take two fermions you make a boson

you cannot put two fermions in the state

but if you make if you make a boson out

of two fermions you can put the tools

you can put two bosons in the same state

but that's not the same as putting the

fermions and it will not woo some kind

of reals

will we see eventually how to put in

like an external field yes I mean in

this right now there's no like an

external field back in here

we yeah he's all like three particles

right external fields can either be

described as classical external fields

or they can be described as large

numbers of quanta and that's a kind of

boundary condition that the effects of

large numbers of quanta should be in one

to be essentially the same within small

deviations from the effect of a

classical field that's of course how a

lot of this was deduced are saying well

somehow the electromagnetic field has to

describe discrete quanta but when

there's a lot of them it better reduce
