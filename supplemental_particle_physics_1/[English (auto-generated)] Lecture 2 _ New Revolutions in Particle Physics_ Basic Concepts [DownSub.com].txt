Stanford University alright um as I said

the basic tool of the trade is quantum

field theory and that is what we're

going to spend a little bit of time

learning I'm going to teach you a very

elementary version of what a quantum

field is I think tonight

but I do want to get up on the

blackboard some basic mathematical facts

just to review and to remind you this is

too elementary to be a serious part of

this class at this point but I do want

to get it up there

the first mathematical set of facts does

have to do with waves waves are of

course an example of fields field

configurations fields or things which

vary throughout space waves a particular

kind of configurations in which the

fields are moving in a wave-like motion

and waves and particles are closely

connected through the link of quantum

mechanics I am NOT going to teach a

quantum mechanics course this clod of

this quarter so if your quantum

mechanics is fuzzy uncertain haha go

back to the lectures on quantum

mechanics the two sets

there was a class called quantum

entanglement which we'll get up there

hopefully soon and another class just

called quantum mechanics and that is the

basic starting point for what the

particle physics is also special

relativity but let's just review very

very quickly one mathematical fact which

comes up over and over and over and over

again just what the relation between

sines cosines and Exponential's

everybody probably most of the people

here know this but I just want to get it

up on the blackboard

for future reference okay let's remember

what an exponential is an exponential is

an exponential function

it has the form an e e is a certain

number to the Alpha X X alpha is a

number it could be any number real or

complex or pure imaginary and e to the

Alpha X is a function of X an

exponential is a function which grows in

this case with respect to X by an amount

each separate little interval of X it

grows by an amount proportional to

itself for example a population of a

petri dish the increase in the

population is proportional to the

population itself and so the hallmark of

an exponential let's call this f of X is

that the derivative of f of X with

respect to X is proportional in this

case with the proportional a

proportionality factor alpha times f

itself the rate of change is

proportional to F itself and such a

function is called an exponential and

it's denoted e to the Alpha X or

something it can be a number of times e

to the Alpha X okay that's the hallmark

of an exponential now let me remind you

of some facts about sines and cosines

and then put them together very quickly

sines and cosines you know what they are

they're functions which oscillate like

this that's sine of X and cosine of X is

exactly the same function except shifted

over by 90 degrees and it looks like

that and I'm sure you all know this I

won't bother going into detail but the

important thing about sine of let's say

KX let's call it sine of KX sine of K

where K is a number any number real

number in this case perms X could be

positive could be net could be negative

and the other function of interest is

cosine of K at

alright sine of KX and cosine of KX can

be differentiated both of them and I'll

just remind you what the derivative is

now you'll remind me what's the

derivative of sine of KX with respect to

X the sine of KX with respect to X is

equal to K times cosine KX and the

derivative of cosine with respect to X

is minus K sine KX so neither one of

these is an exponential neither one has

the property that when you differentiate

it you get something back proportion

it's proportional to itself they have

the odd property that when you

differentiate 1 you get something

proportional to the other whether we're

in one case with a minus sign cosine KX

thank you cosine KX so you differentiate

this one you get the other one you

differentiate the other one you get

minus the first one alright so out of

these two you can now build a

exponential but it's an exponential of

an imaginary thing so let's just let's

just do it once and be done with it if

you take the combination cosine KX plus

I sine KX I being the square root of -1

and you differentiate it with respect to

X what do you get you get from cosine

you get minus sine KX plus I I I'm sorry

minus K sine KX plus I K

cosine KX did I do it correctly now I

think I did which is just spend a couple

of minutes doing the Algebra I times K T

times the original thing back again

cosine KX plus I sine of KX in other

words to make a long story short cosine

KX plus I sine KX is the function e to

the I KX when you differentiate it with

respect to X you get I K times the same

thing all right so that's that's an

important mathematical fact that comes

up over and over again sines and cosines

of course the functions which describe

wave-like oscillations either

oscillations with respect to space if X

is a space coordinate there's an

oscillation the La Salette toolspace

if X happens to be time it corresponds

to an oscillation with respect to time I

will come now let's uh let's consider in

a little more detail well not so much

detail but just quick review all right

we have a wave the wave is moving past

us it has a certain frequency and it has

a certain wavelength let me just remind

you of the connections because we use

them we can call f the frequency it's

the number of cycles that pass you every

second frequency frequency and it's

measured in cycles per second

C stands for cycles per second a cycle

is one full oscillation of the wave

another definition now this is

definition Omega is another form of the

frequency it's the angular frequency

measured in radians per second and it's

just equal to pi times F so f and Omega

are the same thing except for a factor 2

pi

ah and I may go back and forth between

them try to keep equations as simple as

possible with as few factors of Pi so

sometimes I may use Omega sometimes I

may use F okay lambda is of course the

wavelength and now for a light wave a

light wave moves at the speed of light

because it's moving past you with the

speed of light the wavelength and the

frequency are related and they're

related by the formula the wavelength is

the distance traveled in one full cycle

and if you multiply that by the

frequency that gives you the speed of

light that's the velocity the frequency

is how long well the inverse of the time

that it takes to go one full cycle so

this is a distance divided by the time

that it takes to go one for the full

cycle and for a light ray this is see if

it's a sound wave then you put the speed

of sound there if it's a water wave you

put the ball speed of water waves there

or whatever it happens to be but will be

of course particularly interested in in

light waves now that's one set of

equations the other set of equations

that we discussed last time just quick

briefly view review of last time is the

equations of quantum mechanics which

relate wave-like motions the particles

and we're not going to go in heavy depth

into the explanation of these equations

for that you go back and open up the the

lectures on quantum mechanics but

nevertheless I'll try to be as complete

as possible or at least as

self-contained as possible or the

important thing when going to quantum

mechanics is a new number Planck's

constant it comes in two varieties two

separate notations there's the old

Planck's constant which was plunks

original notation

and then there's the new Planck's

constant which is the same as which is

this which is the same as the old

Planck's constant except for a factor of

2 pi and that 2 pi is put there so to

save 2 PI's in somebody else's equation

but if they always come up and there's

just no escape from 2 PI's they're

always you're always going to have them

but the other definition is H bar and

that's the old planets a new Planck

constant that's the old clock constant

divided by 2 pi I will simply save 2

PI's by sometimes using H and sometimes

using H bar try to keep the number of 2

PI's to a minimum now armed lambda times

let's say okay yeah that was that's not

an equation that's just a definition and

what is H H is a number which is a tiny

tiny tiny number anybody remember what

it is 6 times 10 to the minus something

34 or something in some units and some

units are another oh that was an

interesting question it sure my email it

showed up somebody questioning whether

the origin of the unit meter pointing

out let's see what does the meter the

meter is one forty millionth of the way

of the circumference of the earth and

said no I was wrong it didn't have

anything to do with this it's 140

million 30 do you think that somebody

just came along and said let's define a

unit which is 140 millionth of the

circumference of the earth no of course

not that unit had been in use I don't

know what it was called a meter or not

in England it was called the yard but

why 140 million why not 140 trillionth

or 140 well because you wanted some unit

that was easy to deal with for a human

being good to measure rope with good to

measure cloth with whatever

and I do believe that the origin of a

unit which is about the length of a

human beings arm predated knowledge

about what the circumference of the

earth was anyway which in fact was known

for a long time but there brother

yeah in any case in standard units

Meteor seconds and kilograms h-bar is a

very small number do either write

something like 10 to the minus 34 yeah

one point that's little H bar that's H

bar H is 6 times 10 to the minus 34 or

whatever and C of course is 3 times 10

to the 8th meters per second 3 times 10

to the 8th meters per second right okay

so this is just a definition of some

number of definition between a relation

between two numbers but the fact is that

the energy of a single photon a photon

associated with a wave of a given

wavelength and therefore a given

frequency notice this equation here

tells you the relationship between

frequency and wavelength frequency and

wavelength are inverse or inversely

related the bigger one is the smaller

the other is the energy of a single

quantum single quantum energy now this

is not the energy of an electromagnetic

wave this is the energy of one quantum

of the electromagnetic wave that's equal

either to h-bar Omega where Omega is the

frequency of the wave the angular

frequency of the wave incidentally the

frequency of an electromagnetic optical

an optical wave one that you can see

with your eye is very very rapid

something like about 10 to the 15 cycles

per second they'll have that right about

10 to the 15

cycles per second so typically Omega is

very very large into the 15 but a little

over per second but h-bar is more than

small enough to to make the energy of a

single quantum very very small if you

multiply these two in the units that

we've been using you get the energy in

joules and you find out that the energy

in joules is very small 10 to the minus

19th or something like that so we take a

huge number of optical photons to add up

to any appreciable macroscopic

conventional energy all right so the

energy and this of course is also equal

to the other Planck's constant times the

other frequency so they're the same

thing are just two different notations

all right now let's talk about momentum

let's remind ourselves about momentum

energy incidentally and momentum are

especially interesting because they're

conserved quantities they're conserved

our total amount of energy is conserved

total amount of momentum is conserved

and therefore the good bookkeeping

device is good for writing balanced

equations and useful among other things

besides being deep momentum is a vector

it points in a direction points

typically in the direction of motion of

an object it's defined by being

conserved okay but having said that it's

defined by being conserved by the fact

that it's conserved we count it and so

forth we can ask what is the momentum of

various kinds of objects in nature and

the first thing we can write down is the

momentum of a non relativistic object

non relativistic object just means one

moving slower than the speed of light Oh

a lot slower a lot slower than the speed

of light a lot slower the momentum of

such an object is proportional to its

mass times velocity and its velocity is

also a vector

if I give you any pulse of radiation

electromagnetic radiation and it's all

collimated along given direction not a

dispersed wave which is going out in a

variety of different directions but in

which everything is lined up and

collimated along an axis then this is

nonrelativistic the opposite extreme is

super relativistic in other words moving

with the speed of light now this formula

is not right for moving with the speed

of light you could plug in for V the

speed of light but what do you plug in

for M remember I told you M is always by

definition the rest mass where we used

to call the rest mass and a photon

doesn't have a rest mass okay its rest

mass zero try to bring it to rest has

nothing but this is not the right

formula nevertheless the right formula

has a look which looks a bit like this

if we were to have used inappropriately

e equals mc-squared

now mainly I'm using this for unix in

order to get units right energy is mass

times velocity squared then of course

mass would be an energy divided by the

speed of light squared all right now if

I as I said inappropriately ascribed to

a photon a mass equal to its energy

divided by C squared the energy of the

photon divided by C squared and then

said that the velocity of the photon was

C in fact more or less somewhat

accidentally I would get the right

answer that the magnitude of the

momentum this should be read as the

magnitude of the moment

Yeah right but the magnitude of the

momentum is the energy of the photon or

the energy of the electromagnetic wave

for any electromagnetic wave all moving

in a constant direction the direction of

the momentum is of course the direction

of motion of the wave that that's easy

but the magnitude of the momentum is the

energy of the wave divided by the speed

of light from that we can say supposing

the wave consisted only of a single

photon now we're using it legitimately

yeah you get the right answer what is

the momentum of a single photon and to

get the momentum of a single photon you

just plug the energy from here into the

formula for the momentum so let's do

that

the momentum for a single photon well

let's let's do it over here momentum of

a single photon let's write photon over

here cannot be read everybody read that

the momentum of a photon and I'm

concentrating now on its magnitude

incidentally the double bar here means

the magnitude of it the direction is

along the direction of the beam of light

or along the direction of the photon

let's plug it in the energy let's see

let's use this formula over here H times

frequency energy is H frequency divided

by C all right what's the frequency

divided by C right or well 1 over the

wavelength of 1 over the wavelength

frequency divided by C I've divided by C

is equal to 1 over lambda right did I

get that right yes frequency divided by

C is 1 over lambda so this is just the

equation

that the photon momentum photon momentum

in magnitude is equal to Planck's

constant that makes it small times the

frequency divided by C which is divided

by the wavelength so the smaller the

wavelength the larger the momentum of

the photon that's a pattern and it's in

some sense the most important fact

coming from quantum mechanics about

particle physics that if you want short

wavelength for the purposes of studying

very small objects the price that you

pay is you have to put a lot of momentum

equals each h-bar Omega of God is that

the fundamental or is that derived from

some symmetry it derives from the

quantum mechanics of a harmonic

oscillator so the place to look it up is

on lectures previous lectures about the

harmonic oscillator I will make use of

those lectures but that's where it comes

from from a deeper point of view will

come will come to the the right

statements although not the

demonstration of them young just

attention this is we have ways

photons are under a wave it has an

amplitude and always have amplitudes but

a photon itself we haven't talked about

it talk to you giving it such a net let

me answer the question now I would I I

know it was there and I was waiting to

get to the right point but why don't I

just say it now right an electromagnetic

wave or any other wave has several

features one of which I have not written

down here

it's the amplitude of the wave now the

amplitude of the wave well okay here are

two waves with the same frequency the

same every and every respect the same

except that as a and here's another one

one of them is just some small number

times sine KX for example maybe the

small one is a sine KX the other one is

a great big numerical multiple which

I'll call a times sine KX they're

exactly the same except one is much

stronger than the other it's got a

larger amplitude a is the amplitude of

the wave and now the question is in

photon language what is the meaning of

the amplitude or another question you

could ask is what is the amplitude

associated with one photon now the

question is a little bit ambiguous

because quantum mechanics always has

uncertainties technically it has

uncertainties and you can't measure

everything simultaneously for example

you can't measure both the amplitude and

the phase of the wave the phase of the

wave is where it's located but never

mind that

or there's a sensible order magnitude

question order magnitude what is the

amplitude that's associated are with a

single photon for example okay the

answer is the following the energy of a

wave now this is a completely classical

statement completely classical statement

the energy of a wave is proportional

k times the square of the amplitude for

example if this was the electromagnetic

field let's say the electric field or

the magnetic field associated with an

electromagnetic wave what's the energy

of an electromagnetic field it's

proportional to the square of the

electromagnetic field so typically the

energy of a wave is proportional to the

square of the amplitude if you take that

good now the energy of the wave is also

proportional to the number of photons in

that wave

so here I've described for you some

features of a single photon but a wave

of light consists of many photons let's

suppose the number of photons in some

wave of light is in then the energy is

proportional to n in fact the energy

will be in the number of photons times H

bar Omega so that means that there's a

proportionality between the square of

the amplitude on the one hand and the

number of photons in that wave let's

just call it little in the precise exact

detailed connection I'll work out for

you another time but the square of the

amplitude of the wave is proportional to

the number of photons now there's a

factor of H bar in there because the

square of the amplitude is the energy

and we should have an H bar H bar Omega

and the energy so the square of the

amplitude is proportional to H bar and

in now of course the point is that H bar

is an extremely small number this is the

energy of the wave another form another

way of writing the energy of a wave with

many photons not a single photon but

many photons

right now you say well look this is a

terribly tiny number how can you get any

appreciable amount of energy in an

electromagnetic wave well the answer is

by having a lot of photons

so a typical electromagnetic wave that

carries an appreciable energy has an

enormous number of photons to overwhelm

this factor of H bar but the amplitude

if you like a is proportional to the

square root of the number of photons so

that's the missing that's the missing

wave characteristic that I didn't write

down here and as I said it is

proportional to the confusion about the

oscillation we used in a diagram of the

MV field that are perpendicular and

there the temptation to think of that as

a spatial you know the height of the

sine wave

no no right okay right okay so here's a

wave it's moving down the x-axis what's

plotted vertically here is not the

y-axis or the z-axis what's plotted

vertically the electric field right so

this is not a plot there's only one of

the directions here corresponds to space

the other direction of course

corresponds to the electric or the

magnetic field I think that's what you

are asking me to clarify and properly so

now of course the wave could be oriented

in any direction that way that way that

way and the momentum carried by the wave

is along the axis that the wave is

moving yeah say number of photons in the

way oh you you mean number of photons

within one period let's say you move in

one third of it yeah yeah because a

square this is like the powered energy

that's right so that's why this area to

say within one within one wavelength

that's right well the proportionality I

purposefully wrote proportional to here

if we were talking about two wavelengths

three wavelengths for wavelengths of

course the answer but guess you got the

out you got the right idea

well order-of-magnitude it's given by

this formula with n equals 1 but yes in

some sense it is meaningless

it says meaningless for an

electromagnetic wave electromagnetic

wave has both a magnetic field and an

electric field now the magnetic field in

the electric field are related to each

other by a relation which is similar

mathematically to the relationship

between the position of a particle and

the velocity of a particle and those are

things which cannot be measured

simultaneously they are the uncertainty

principle prevents you from knowing both

of them and in the same way there's an

uncertainty principle between electric

field and magnetic field that prevents

you from knowing both of them so yes

there is it there are limitations on how

well you can know the amplitude but as

an order of magnitude statement this is

correct well we'll try to do better as

we go along we're sort of getting into

the subject of quantum field theory

which is a difficult and abstract

subject ok um I wrote down some

equations here which are true for

photons some of them are true for any

particle others are not

alright the definition of frequency

that's the general definition Omega

being 2 pi F that's perfectly good

lambda equals a wavelength that's a

definition this is true for waves which

will move with the speed of light so it

would not be true for a general wave

let's let's put something around those

equations which are not expected to be

of great general generality by great

generality I mean they would be true for

almost any kind of wave or particle

whether or not it moves of the speed of

light this is not so general this is not

so general anything that has a seen it

will not be very general when I say not

general it'll be general for anything

which moves with the speed of light ok

this is general

now energy equals H bar Omega that is

also a very general fact this clearly

neither of these this is specific to

things which move with the speed of

light this is specific to objects which

move with much less than the speed of

light there's an interpolation

in-between which I won't get into now

which is true for things which move with

some fraction of the speed of light so I

can um where were we yeah we were we

were trying to figure out which

equations are great generality which are

not this one

H F over C that contains C in it

that is not terribly general oops

where's my blue momentum equals H

divided by lambda is general okay now

where this comes from I'm not going to

try to prove these things to you now I'm

just telling you as facts go back to

your quantum mechanics momentum is H

over lambda that's general okay let's

use these facts now here's the

relationship for a photon between what

is it arm between frequency and

wavelength and as I said it's not very

general what about a slowly moving

electron or a slowly moving nucleus or

for that matter a slowly moving bowling

ball what's the relationship between

frequency and wavelength can we figure

it out is it something on the blackboard

or something

that we have to add something else

question for an electron I did tell you

last time that electrons are also

described by waves

did I not I told you that you can do

interference experiments with electrons

so there is an electron wave let's call

it Sai

and the question now is what is the

relationship between frequency and

wavelength can we figure it out

yes we can but we need to know one fact

about nonrelativistic systems it's the

analog of knowing it is not the analog

it's knowing the relation between

momentum and energy okay but for an

electron moving slowly the momentum is

not the energy divided by the speed of

light what is it

okay energy is equal to now we can start

at the beginning and right I mean

kinetic energy one-half MV squared and

the momentum MV P equals MV so we can

solve for the velocity P over m

everything is a vector but that's

alright we don't know that's right and

then the energy becomes one-half M times

V squared and V squared is P squared

over m squared if you don't know this

equation it's an important equation it

occurs over and over the energy in terms

of the momentum is one-half P squared

divided by M people get confused the M

is upstairs when you multiply by the

velocity squared its downstairs when you

multiply by the momentum squared okay

now we have what we need to find the

relationship between frequency and

wavelength energy is where is it is

h-bar Omega or H times frequency let's

use H times frequency of a single of a

single electron now we're talking about

a single electron H times the frequency

of the wave describing that electron H

times frequency that's energy on the

right hand side we have one-half

let's put the N downstairs and what

about the momentum the momentum is H

divided by lambda so that's H squared

over lambda squared and we can divide

this equation by H and we find that the

frequency is 1 over 2m times plunks

constant divided by the square this time

of the of the wavelength notice how

different it is are over here the

frequency was proportional to 1 over the

wavelength here it's 1 over the

wavelength squared you don't have to

remember this you have to memorize this

you can always read the rive it the

basic ingredients are the equation for

the energy and the relationship between

momentum wavelength frequency and all

that kind of stuff

all right this is just the illustrate

the connections so that's a non

relativistic particle when moving slowly

for example electron in an atom

the frequency of its Schrodinger wave

would be 1 over 2m times Planck's

constant divided by the wavelength

squared

let me stop me slow down now and pick

some questions that is true for any

particle as long as it's moving slowly

compared to the speed of light

maybe we should well we'll come back and

we'll interpolate between the slow and

the fast another time there is an

interpolation the gino is well depends

on how fast a neutrino is moving most

neutrinos in nature are moving very fast

with close to the speed of light very

close to the speed of light so for

neutrinos the speed of light is a good

approximation for but in principle

neutrinos can be slowed down and if

they're moving with very much less than

the speed of light it's the other

formula a non relativistic formula yeah

and so that's where electrons passing

wait yeah

welcome back to a relation between

amplitudes and and and quanta soon

enough and that's that's what the whole

story is about but we haven't gotten in

an electron accelerator let's say with

20 kV however accelerator with 20 kV

very low energy exhaustion example it's

a slow fest it's a lot to consider slow

or fast damage for an electron slow so

all right well you I could alright um if

you want to know first of all let's work

in units in which C is equal to 1 in

such units momentum and energy have the

same year exactly the same units where

do we have it

momentum and energy have exactly the

same units of C is equal to 1 if you

want to know if something is

relativistic a non relativistic you want

to compare its momentum to its mass if

its momentum is large compared to its

mass its rest mass photon has no rest

mass and so its momentum is always much

larger than its a that its mass and so

it's highly relativistic its

relativistic as it can be the figure of

Merit the thing that you compare is the

momentum to the rest mass so now you

have to tell me what's the rest mass of

an electron you gave me in ke V ok ke V

killer electron volts is a unit of

energy all right and remember energy and

momentum have the same units so what's

the mass of an electron half a million

electron volts so 20 ke V is a lot less

than 20 then half a million and so

that's a slow that's a slow electron

right any other cookies any other

question

frequency and wavelength for a real way

or related yeah start participar

clockwise ready so is that equation the

left one you have did you rewrite a

facebook scheme and get the right

equation but electrons electron waves do

not move with the speed of light so

there's no C so the question is can you

derive a velocity from this yes the

answer is yes you can but it won't be

lost

ah maybe probability well oh there are

two yeah yeah there are two velocities

to go to the waves one of them is called

the group velocity one of them is called

a phase velocity I'll I'll be specific

since you asked me if you take a general

wave the wave let's assume it's a wave

packet now a wave packet means that it

looks like a wave except that it it's

some confined to some packet like

structure like that so it locally looks

like a wave meaning to say a plane wave

a sine or a cosine but it has an

envelope that that sort of combined

confines it to some region now in

general in general depending on the

specific nature of the wave you'll see

that as that wave moves there are two

separate velocities associated with it

and they're different

one of them is the overall velocity of

the wave packet the other is the

velocity of the crests and troughs or

whatever you call them and what you

would see if you looked at this wave

let's say from some other perspective

where you see waves and troughs moving

along is you would see the packet moving

with one velocity but the waves moving

through the packet with a different

velocity in fact typically the wave the

the one is called the phase velocity

that's the velocity of the troughs and

peaks and valleys and the other was

called group velocity the group velocity

is the velocity of the whole packet

guess which one you identify with the

nonrelativistic velocity of the particle

the group velocity and the group

velocity is usually slower than the

phase velocity the phase velocity is not

got to do with the actual velocity of

the particle now there is one special

case the special case is when all waves

of all frequencies move with the same

velocity that would not be true for a

none relativistic wave like this let's

see the velocity is the frequency times

the wavelength right so let's let's look

at this the frequency times the

wavelength is just frequency times

wavelength as 1 over 2m h-bar over

lambda so different lambdas move with

different velocities different lambdas

move with different velocities and when

different wavelengths move with

different velocities you have this

situation where group and phase

velocities are not the same for the

special case where all wavelengths move

with the same velocity then group and

phase velocities are the same so for a

light wave all waves move with the same

velocity the group and the packet

velocity the the group and the phase

velocity are the same that's a special

and simplify a simple case all right but

we didn't I just wanted to illustrate

some of the equations here and

incidentally this equation over here

is equivalent to another equation of

physics anybody know what it is the

Schrodinger equation the Schrodinger

equation is an equation for a wave and

this tells you the time dependence of

the wave the frequency this tells you

the space dependence of the wave the

Schrodinger equation is exactly an

equation for the relationship between

the time dependence of a wave and the

space dependence of the way we will come

back to it but this is just the

Schrodinger equation in a slightly

disguised form for better yet if you

knew the Schrodinger equation and you

said supposing I had a wave of a given

frequency that had a given wave length

what would the equation tell me about

the relation between wavelength and

frequency and it would be exactly this

okay so that's the Schrodinger equation

in a nutshell I think the face velocity

grow faster than life yes yes yes yes

but the phase velocity as a rule carries

no information with it you can't send

information faster than the group

velocity phase velocity doesn't really

carry any any information with it so

we'll come back to that it's it's a

technical issue that we don't need to

deal with right at this moment okay

let's see let's go on a little bit more

with waves there are one or two other

concepts about waves that are necessary

and you know there's a lot of technical

details and I'm getting into but every

single piece of it is really very

central or important okay we will be

interested in waves moving in infinite

space but I use the word infinite space

infinite infinity computers don't like

infinity

and if physics is the art of writing

equations that computers can solve in

principle it is necessary to always

remove the infinities and write the

equations for finite systems first and

then take a limit

all right so in studying quantum

mechanics waves quantum field theory

particle physics and so forth it's

necessary in the back of your mind to

get rid first around of everything

that's infinite and state the problems

as if everything were finite and in

particular what I have in mind now is

the extent of space itself so one way of

what I want you to think about now is a

wave moving in one dimension three

dimensions is really no different than

one dimension except there are three of

them so let's concentrate on one

dimensional wave motion could be a

violin string it could be a rope being

wiggled back and forth or it could just

be a wave in a mathematical universe of

one dimension one way of getting rid of

the infinity of space would be to make

the wave only propagate on a region of

length L for example by holding down the

wave at this end holding down your

string at this in just like a violin

string is held down holding it down at

this end you can have all sorts of waves

and the waves move and they bounce off

when they get to the end they bounce off

and reflect and they go back and forth

and back and forth that's a perfectly

good way to describe things the problem

with this kind of let's call it boundary

condition this is called the boundary

condition namely that waves when they

get to the end reflect it's called a

reflecting boundary condition the

problem with it is it violates one of

the important conservation laws of

physics what would that conservation law

be

momentum after all if the momentum of a

wave is it's a vector quantity it points

in a direction if a wave is moving along

this at has a little wave it's moving

along this axis its momentum is pointing

to the right

when against to the end it bounces off

and reflects so the momentum has changed

sign

okay the momentum has changed sign the

momentum is not conserved that's okay

there's nothing wrong with it you can

study it but if you want to keep track

of things like momentum conservation

there's a smarter thing you can do it

goes as follows imagine this line is

such that we identify the beginning and

the end now we can do that by replacing

the line by a circle it doesn't have to

be a legitimate geometric circle just

mathematically we connect the beginning

back to the a so we go on a cycle

alright so as we move from here to here

to here we can imagine we start here

move along here and in this magic line

when you get to the other end you come

back to the beginning that's a closed

circle I don't want to call it a circle

because I don't mean to imply it's a

circle in two dimensions I just want to

imply that it's periodic periodic is the

term for this periodic space now you can

imagine a wave which is moving along

moving along here and when it comes to

the end over here what does it do it

just keeps going right it just keeps

going it doesn't care about that point

that point is not a special point

anymore and so the wave just keeps

cycling around cycling around cycling

around and the momentum is conserved

it doesn't suddenly reflect into the

direction in terms of this picture you

can just imagine when the wave gets to

this end it reappears at this end and it

just keeps going to the right if it were

going to the right it go

to the left of it we're going to the

left and just keeps going forever with

this trick with this mathematical trick

of replacing space by a periodic space

we can first of all get rid of the

Infinity in the size of space feed it

into a computer and we can get rid of

the problem of momentum of noma of non

momentum conservation momentum is now

conserved but there is a cost I don't

know that it's a cost but it's a fact

the fact is that in such a world

momentum is quantized now I don't mean

in the sense that well it is that

momentum only comes in discrete

multiples of a unit and it's useful to

work in understanding quantum fields

that relation to particles and so forth

is useful to remember that the momentum

comes in discrete multiples of something

so let's see how that works well first

of all it's obvious that the wavelength

an integer number of waves must fill it

let's let's give this distance around

here a name let's call it L L for length

if it were a circle it would be the

circumference but let's just call it L

the total distance around from beginning

back to beginning again quote L all

right if we're going to put a wave in

there and let's say now that it's a way

of a sine or a cosine wave assault

whatever an integer number of

wavelengths has to fit onto the circle

that means that the wavelength has to be

equal to the length around divided by an

integer okay

divided by an integer so the wavelength

must be a total distance around divided

by some integer I don't want to call the

integer in let's see a calculate capital

n

Capital n little n will be reserved for

something else so the wavelength is

necessarily the total distance around

divided by n now that means the

wavelength comes in discrete

possibilities it can be L it can be L

over 2 it can be L over 3 it can be L

over 4 but it can't be L times the

square root of 2 or L divided by the

square root of 2 an integer number of

waves just won't fit in here in other

words if you try to put a wavelength of

the wrong wavelength in here by the time

you got back the wave wouldn't match was

what it was supposed to be at the

beginning ok so that tells you that

wavelengths come in discrete calm

possibilities with the integer appearing

the denominator now we had an equation

here somewheres for momentum in terms of

wavelength what was it

momentum was equal h-bar yes H over

lambda

P is equal to H over lambda so now this

is also telling us that momenta come in

discrete possibilities the momentum of

any quantum must satisfy the constraint

that it's H divided by an allowable

wavelength so the allowable momenta of

quanta the allowable momenta of

electrons the allowable momenta of

photons the allowable momentum of

anything in this one-dimensional world

has to be H divided by okay let's work

it out that's H divided by lambda that

means n divided by L I turned lambda

upside down and over L and what does it

say it says the momenta come in discrete

multiples of a basic unit and the basic

unit is Planck's constant divided by the

total distance around there's a neat

fact if you put a particle and you put

it in if you put a particle on a wire

and the wire is a circular wire a bead a

bead on a wire that bead can only have

momenta which are discrete multiples of

1 over L naught n over Ln is the

multiple 1 over L 1 over the length of

the wire now of course H is a very small

number and the L if L is a big

macroscopic length of wire or something

1 over L is a very small number and so

the quanta the separation between

different mo values different allowed

values of the momenta is very small you

can get own if L is large and H is small

you can get almost any number not almost

any number but you can get a very dense

collection of possible numbers

all right but okay that's the that's the

quantization of momentum in a world in

which everything is periodic yeah total

momentum not total momentum of the of a

of the object total momentum of any

quantum now if every quantum has to have

a integer multiple of this basic unit of

momentum then any number of quanta also

have to have an integer multiple of it

all right you might have each quantum is

identified in terms of its value of in

in terms of its momentum but there are

allowed momentum and disallowed momentum

the allowed momentum are discrete

multiples of a basic unit and any number

of photons electrons and so forth

necessarily come in this discrete

multiples

this is

we get to get stationary model when you

come back to the same place what is that

scene something

well that's the assumption that that the

space is really genuinely periodic that

there's nothing special about any point

and it is a fair question it is a good

question

but it's also the assumption that for

example the electromagnetic wave

electric field is a observable quantity

and it doesn't have sudden jumps in it

in fact a sudden jump you would have if

it didn't come back to itself we would

have to make a sudden jump at this point

a sudden jump is very costly in energy

and in momentum so sudden jumps and

fields fields are continuous things

they're not allowed to jump like that if

you have what what can we package eyes

oh that's alright any packet ah that's a

good word any packetized wave that's a

packetized wave is a sum of individual

plane waves sines and cosines that's the

Fourier analysis the statement the real

statement is any allowable wave is a sum

of waves each of which has this discreet

this discretized the possible values of

momentum so it's a statement about

Fourier transforms that the Fourier

analysis of any allowable wave only has

these discrete multiples of a basic unit

of P

the center problem would help very very

small yeah small as momentum it's very

very very big ah how small very small

you don't wanna get smaller than the

plonk line that's it that's it that's it

that's a bad thing to do up till that

now there's no problem oh we could yeah

what let's pursue this a moment

something that's not in my notes but

let's pursue it it's important let's

really imagine now that we genuinely

have a particle moving on a genuine

circular wire a fun let's really now

take a bead moving on a really circular

wire and see if we can understand what

this quantization of momentum means in

another language let's take the circular

wire to have a radius R let it have a

radius R oh I erased the important

equation what was the important equation

the important equation was the allowable

momentum is equal to an integer times H

over lambda over sorry over L or L right

okay now the radius of the orbit is R

and that means that P is n H over 2 pi

all right you can see by now that h-bar

would have been a better choice in this

equation right let's leave it let's

leave it and later on we'll put back

h-bar okay that's the momentum and the

momentum is quantized every single

electron photon or anything else has to

have an integer multiple of this now

what about the angular momentum what's

the relation

between momentum radius and angular

momentum for a circular orbit for the

simplest possible ah yes it is every R

well for a non relativistic particle its

MV R and we are L stands for angular

momentum MV R but what is MV P so as P

times R now NV r is not completely

general for a relativistic particle the

momentum is not n times V but angular

momentum is equal to momentum times

distance is very general that is for

particle that is the definition of the

momentum at least for a circular orbit

for other orbits it's the cross product

R cross P but it's always R times P and

so now look at this what this says is

that R times P multiplied by our angular

momentum is an integer multiple of H

divided by 2 pi or an integer multiple

of plunks other constant alright so

momentum is another quantity which is

axial angular momentum is a quantity

which is quantized but always in the

same unit unlike the momentum here the

momentum is quantized in a unit which

depends on the angular on loops that I

use alpha 2 things excuse me what should

I call our angular momentum

angular momentum am I will eventually

change that I don't like that but but

for the moment angular momentum alright

is n times H bar momentum is quantized

in this periodic world but the unit of

momentum depends on the length around

the circuit okay

the angular momentum is quantized but

always in units of h-bar okay all

angular momenta come in units of h-bar

except when they don't

when they don't is when you have

fermions but we'll come to that that's

later not tonight

okay there are exceptions to this rule

okay um now we want in the next hour to

invent the idea of a quantum field and

what is a quantum field in the simplest

possible case the simplest possible

situation what exactly is a quantum

field how is the quantum field related

to particles and to its quanta what is

the connection between particles and

fields with some precision and that's

what we'll do next but let's take a

let's take a five-minute break alright

now we have to enter into the real world

of quantum mechanics a little bit and

for that if you're not

our knowledgeable about it you have

various alternatives one is to go to

sleep another is to listen and try to

get you know sort of a what's the right

word for a very impressionistic what

yeah you know get the oh there must be

some word for very impressionistic sort

of soft fuzzy feel for things third is

to go back left what I hope to do better

than that please and the third is to go

back and learn a little bit about of

quantum mechanics there will be nothing

here that I haven't discussed in

previous lectures on quantum mechanics

in particular the most important thing

for our purposes now is one of the

simplest of all quantum systems the

harmonic oscillator why does the

harmonic oscillator come up the harmonic

oscillator is important for a great many

reasons but in our particular context

it's because waves are oscillations if

you just see a wave going past you

obviously the amp with the field

electric magnetic whatever it is

oscillates in fact the fact that

oscillates is equivalent to the

statement that it has a frequency a wave

maybe way made up out of a superposition

of many different wavelengths for

example light you can mix together

different colors of light and create

light of mixed different wavelengths but

you can also separate it as did Newton

into its component wavelengths and so

every light wave can be thought of as

being made up of individual components

each with its own frequency its own

amplitude and so forth

therefore it

be thought up as being made up out of a

collection of quanta and the quanta are

not all of the same energy and momentum

but still it can be separated into

quanta of different energy and momentum

and each energy and momentum is

associated with a wavelength each

wavelength is associated with a

frequency and a frequency is by

definition and oscillation so one can

think of a wave as a collection of

harmonic oscillators harmonic

oscillators being the simplest kind of

oscillation sines and cosines in order

to proceed with what a quantum field is

we have to go back to what the harmonic

oscillator is so let's let's begin with

the harmonic oscillator quantum

mechanics is a strange theory it has

things numbers in it which don't satisfy

the usual rules of arithmetic

technically they are operators

representing the observable things that

you can measure and they have some rules

you can add them you can multiply them

but they don't necessarily commute what

does that mean that means if you have

two variables describing two different

attributes or properties of a system

each of which by itself might be

measurable might be something you can

measure let's call them a and B just to

give them names a could stand for

example for electric field B could stand

for magnetic field or a could stand for

the position of an electron B could

stand for the electric field but any two

pair of things then ordinarily in

ordinary mathematics of course the

product of them doesn't matter which

order you multiply them a times B is

equal to B times a that's just the

property of numbers in quantum mechanics

of course that is not generally true it

may or may not be true of two

observable quantities well it's not true

we just write that the difference

between these is not equal to zero now

what nonsense I mean if I measure the

electric field and it's some number and

I measure the magnetic field and it's

some other number and I multiply them

what how can it possibly be that it

doesn't make sense to multiply them in

the opposite order and get the same

answer generally speaking when the

answer depends on the order of

multiplication what it really means in

other words when this is not zero what

it really means is that you can't

measure both of these things

simultaneously that they interfere with

each other the experiment that measures

one of them necessarily screws up the

measurement of the other one and in that

sense there's no contradiction when this

is not zero simply means you can't

measure both of them together when you

can measure two things simultaneously

and you measure them you get numbers for

them when you multiply the numbers the

numbers have to commute it doesn't

matter which order you multiply them in

and so the test for whether you can

measure two things at the same time is

whether this quantity which is also

called the commutator a B minus B a is

called the commutator of a and B commute

commutator you know like going back and

forth go in to working back you

interchange the order of them it's

labeled by a bracket with a comma and a

and B the order matters so typically

this is not equal to zero

incidentally the commutator of B with a

e that's just exactly the same thing

except in the opposite order and that's

just a sign difference these two are the

same except for a sign okay that the

that's quantum mechanics in a nutshell

we just did quantum mechanics

examples now I'm not proving this I'm

just telling you this now but

nevertheless it's fact partly empirical

fact partly mathematical fact a particle

has different components of position x

y&z for example you can measure the

position of a particle so the components

of position of a particle are candidates

for things which are observables these

things commute with each other you can

measure the X and the y of a particle at

the same time you can measure the X the

Y and the Z of a particle all three

simultaneously what else can you measure

about a particle you can measure its

velocity or its momentum mass times

velocity and those things are called the

components of them are called px py and

PZ they're the components of the vector

momentum and they also commute with each

other you can measure the three

components or better yet the magnitude

and nima and the direction of of the

momentum but you can measure all three

components simultaneously there's no

obstruction they commute with each other

so X commutes with Y commutes with Z P X

commutes with py commutes with PZ but

the components of position do not

commute with the polar components of

momentum so for example you cannot

measure the position the X component of

the position of a particle and the X

component of the momentum every time you

try to measure the X component of

position you will give the particle a

whack and change its momentum and the

result is you can't measure both of them

this is not equal to zero it's equal to

I times Planck's constant it's small

simply reflecting the fact that

well the uncertainties in position and

momentum are small and of order H bar

likewise for the Y components the Y

position and the y momentum don't

commute with each other

same for the Z components how about X

with the y component of momentum can you

measure X and the y components of

momentum simultaneously yes as a matter

of fact you can that that may not be

obvious but it is true okay so that's

another aspect of quantum mechanics and

now let's consider the harmonic

oscillator now I'm telling you facts for

the most part but I'll try to put the

mathematical facts into some kind of

context these are the facts that we went

through previous quarters so I'm not

going to derive it when you go from X to

Y no this is the square root of -1 this

is not the I J this is not our J and K

which are unit vectors along the three

axes and they're also not quaternions

which also have an i J and a K

associated with XY and Z but nope just I

just the square root of -1 where does

the square root of -1 get into a formula

like this don't don't ask we we we don't

we're not going to need it the fact is

we won't really need it we just need to

know that algebraic manipulations in

quantum mechanics are a little bit funny

and the funniness is that you can't as a

rule interchange the orders of our

operations

sir yeah that's not a ap - beer that

means first measure a it doesn't mean

measure this is a it doesn't mean

measure forget measuring are these are

simply mathematical manipulations which

are yeah it doesn't mean first measure a

and then measure B it's simply a not

simply it is a mathematical manipulation

that the matrix multiplication operate a

multiplication yes but we're not going

to we're not going through the

principles of quantum mechanics here I'm

just restating things that we've learned

in the past and if you need to

understand them better the only way to

do it is to go back to earlier lectures

okay

nice and sliced but close there is a it

doesn't really apply to a photon it

applies strictly speaking to

nonrelativistic particles the problem is

that the position of a photon is not so

well defined the position of a photon is

harder to define in the position of a

non relativistic particle so but let's

say we can come back to that

that's a subtlety which is not terribly

important to us now okay the harmonic

oscillator the harmonic oscillator is a

system a classical system which has a

quantum mechanical analog and it simply

means a system which oscillates a weight

on the end of a spring which oscillates

up and down on a sound wave that

oscillates a light wave that oscillates

anything that oscillates like a spring

going back and forth we can think of

thousands of examples and the

mathematics of them is always the same

every oscillation or every oscillator

has a frequency it can either be taken

and we can call it an Omega the

frequency again is 2pi times the number

of cycles per second alright cycle per

second for a spring with a weight on it

is just how long it takes to go through

one full swing and come back to the same

place not just the same place but the

same velocity so if you have a weight on

the end of a spring and it oscillates

it's the the frequency is not how long

it takes to come back to the same place

but how long it takes to come back to

the same place moving in the same

direction so one full oscillation is the

period the number of cycles or number of

oscillations per second is the free

qín C F and as usual Omega is 2 pi F

nothing unusual

the usual Omega now what is unusual

about the quantum mechanical harmonic

oscillator is that energy is quantized

not momentum not the but energy is

quantized this is something which you'll

either look up or accept so let's plot

vertically the energy levels of such a

harmonic oscillator classically of

course there was a lowest energy which

is zero just the oscillator at rest and

then you give it a little poke and it

starts to swing back and forth and you

can give it any positive value of energy

of course if you hit it too hard and try

to give it too much energy you might

melt the spring or I'll break the spring

but in a mathematically idealized

version of the harmonic oscillator you

can give it any positive value of energy

not so the quantum mechanical oscillator

the quantum mechanical oscillator has

discrete integer units of energy if we

call the lowest energy 0 sometimes it's

appropriate to call the lowest energy

not quite zero but we can define we can

define the lowest energy to be zero then

what's the next energy level h-bar Omega

the same formula as the energy of a

photon of frequency Omega what's the

next one - h-bar Omega that could either

be the energy of a single photon

associated with a frequency twice as big

as the first one

or it could correspond to two

Tan's both associated with a wave of

frequency Omega it's the second idea

that I want to dwell on that this has

the same energy as two photons now so

far there are no photons there's only

Springs and balls and oscillations back

and forth but nevertheless this does

have the energy of one photon associated

with a frequency Omega this has the

energy of two photons of frequency Omega

and so forth

three h-bar Omega and so forth those are

the possible energies of the harmonic

oscillator

nothing in between we can label them

with an integer and we can write that

the energy is an integer times H bar

Omega wherein is just an integer which

labels which one of these states the

oscillator is oscillating in it's just a

matter of notation for us here it's just

a matter of notation mathematics of it

we don't need to get into we label the

various states of the oscillator by an

integer N and it's conventional to just

label the states of the oscillator by a

little pointy thing like that

that's called a cat it's called a ket

because it's the right hand side of a

bracket but we don't need the brat in

that we only need the ket end of it and

it's a as I said go back and study

quantum mechanics but all this is all

this labels this is a symbol

representing if you put N equals 0 here

it represents the state of the

oscillator where it's in its ground

state ground state means the lowest

energy state if you put a 1 here it

represents the oscillator oscillating

with one quantum of energy one unit of

energy you put a 2 here it represents

the oscillator with 2 units of energy

and so forth right so it's just a note

it's just a convenient notation for

labeling the various possible

configurations of the quantum harmonic

oscillator

now let's invent an operation it's

actually not only an operation it's an

operate or there's a difference an

operator and this operator acts on a

state to change the state to a new state

so a mathematical operation which takes

you from any state to the neighboring

one one unit above it acts on this state

to give you this one acts on this state

to give you this one acts on this state

to give you this one acts on this state

to give you this one so we can write

down what it does let's call it a plus

and the plus indicates that it raises

the energy of a state and then act on

the end state to give one n plus one but

with a coefficient in front of it square

root of n plus one now this is mumbly

jumbly unless you know the bit about the

mathematics of linear operators and so

forth so as I said either you know it

then you can follow it or you don't know

it then you can just get a hazy

impression of what it means but this is

the mathematical property of this

operation here it multiplies any state

vector by a square root of n plus 1 and

raises you to the next level but

basically it's a shift a thing which

shifts you from one level to the next

it's just an operation which shifts you

from one level to the next and we got to

keep track of a numerical coefficient in

front of it what about a - what does it

do takes you down

and minus one what's the coefficient

square root of n square root of n what

happens if this one acts on the bottom

state where does it take you it doesn't

take you anywhere it just gives you zero

that's because if it acts on the bottom

state n is zero and it just gives you

zero nothing no state they're just the

non state there's nothing to get to so

it just gives you zero all right this is

the mathematics of creation and

annihilation operators or raising and

lowering operators now we're just going

to we're going to do some little mumbo

jumbo with it I'm going to show you some

properties of these operations they're

interesting they're entertaining and you

can do some you can have say fun with

them just knowing some very simple set

of rules for it and this is the rules

let's see what happens if we take the

state N and multiply it first by a minus

and then by a plus in other words let's

hit it with a minus and then a plus what

do we get okay all we do is follow the

rules alright so first of all oh one one

important thing some things are just

numbers not everything is one of these

peculiar things that where the order of

multiplication matters some things are

really just numbers things like in are

just numbers that means that the order

that you multiply them doesn't matter

some things the order of multiplication

is perfectly ordinary in in

is always something rather ordinary okay

so what happens what happens what is

this equal to well let's take it in

pieces

let's first multiply a minus by n what

does it give a plus and then a minus

times n is what square root of n times n

minus 1 so let's take that on the

outside and n minus 1 now what happens

if we hit it with a plus if we hit any

vector or any sorry any state with a

plus it raises us back it raises us to

the next level up but multiplies by

square root of n plus 1 but what is

square root of n plus 1 here mean it

just means square root of n since I'm

now starting at n minus 1 hitting it

with a plus will give me square root of

n another square root of n + n square

root of n times square root of n is in

it just gives me the number n times n

that's just a little game that we're

playing we're playing a little game with

a set of logical rules here and what we

find out is if we multiply by a plus and

a minus with this set of logical rules

it's equivalent to multiplying by the

numerical number in whatever state we

put here if we put here the first a zero

state therefore if we put here the

lowest state we get zero if we put here

the first state we get one we put it in

the second state we get two and so forth

so whenever we do this combined set of

operations it picks out for us it picks

out for us the numerical level and tells

us which level we're at if we want to

find out which level we're talking about

I may not know what it is I may just

call it by some other name of Lupus we

just put Lucas here we want to find out

what in blue this corresponds to well we

multiply it by 8 plus time

- and we find out what the numerical

coefficient is that numerical

coefficient tells us what what level of

the oscillator we were playing with so

we can write this in another way we can

simply write that multiplication by a

plus times a minus is the same as

multiplication by n but what is in n is

simply the energy level well not quite

the energy level we need something else

we need H bar Omega we need to multiply

by H bar Omega so we can write in H bar

Omega is H bar Omega times a plus a -

and what does that tell us that tells us

that the energy of the oscillator if we

didn't know what the energy of the

oscillator was we could find out

mathematically mathematical experiment

but as a matter of playing this logical

game we could determine what level we

were talking about by taking the state

unknown state and multiplying it by a

plus a - times H bar Omega now this is a

little game as I said and doesn't

correspond to any actual experiment but

in fact this is the actual energy of the

oscillator okay so that's a mathematical

bunch of tricks bunch of trickery let's

multiply them in the opposite order all

right so what did we find out we found

out that a plus times a minus is equal

to n meaning to say that if you do this

operation on any state it just

multiplies by n what about the opposite

order let's try it in the opposite order

using the same little logical rules a

minus times a plus on n what does that

give did I do that right a minus times a

plus the opposite order so what is a

plus give

this gives square root of n plus 1 times

n plus 1 right and now let's multiply

that by a - a - we'll bring you back

down to n but it will give you another

factor of square root of n plus 1 all

right whenever a - axe it gives you the

numerical coefficient which is the same

as the thing inside here so that gives

you square of square root of n plus 1

times square root of n plus 1 again

times n brings you back down but gives

you the factor overall factor of n plus

1 so what do we find

we found that multiplying in the

opposite order gives us different

answers almost the same answer but not

quite in one order a + a - is N and the

other order a minus times a plus is n

plus 1 so with this little bit of

logical gamesmanship here or

mathematical symbology we find that the

order of these two operations isn't the

singer well what does that mean does

that mean that a plus and a minus that

if we were to measure them and count and

then take the values that we measure for

them the numerical values whatever they

are whatever they correspond to we

measure them that when we multiply their

values by each other they don't they

don't commute that doesn't make sense

numbers always commute when we multiply

them what this means is that whatever a

plus and a minus correspond to you can't

measure both of them simultaneously now

what they correspond to is a combination

of the amplitude of this harmonic

oscillator how big the oscillation is

and it's phase it's phase does everybody

know what the phase of an oscillation is

it's basically the

in which the oscillator passes through

the origin the oscillator can oscillate

back and forth or you can delay it a

little bit so that it goes through the

origin of the later or earlier time you

can't you can't whatever a is you can't

measure it a plus and a minus

simultaneously that's what this tells

you that's all it tells you that they

don't commute and therefore they're not

simultaneously measurable but they're

still interesting mathematical little

objects what do they do what do they do

they are mathematical operations which

raise you up and down this tower what do

they do they add and subtract quanta of

energy of the oscillator

now if the oscillator happens to

correspond to an electromagnetic

oscillation an oscillation of the

electromagnetic field then what these

operators do is they add and subtract

photons they add and subtract photons

they are what are called creation and

annihilation operators all right so

let's up on any physical experiment to

talk about well you can measure the

number of photons but you can't measure

the a plus in the a minus separately you

know it's an interesting question of

whether you can measure a plus or a

minus individually and the answer for

technical reasons is no but but but this

doesn't tell you that okay all right so

we have the idea now of operations or

mathematical quantum mechanical

operations which would make no sense

classically at all we wouldn't we

wouldn't multiply States by the

operators like this but quantum

mechanically we have the idea of

creation and annihilation operators

mathematical operations which add and

act quanta of energy for a fixed

frequency now when we have a system

which has many oscillators you can

imagine we have many Springs with many

balls hanging off from of different

frequencies or you can imagine

electromagnetic waves in a cavity each

different wavelength has a different

frequency we can excite them

independently we can excite one way if

we can excite another wave excite them

independently then we have a system

which contains many different

oscillations with many different

frequencies that means to describe this

may be a good place to slow down a

little bit this is this of course is a

little bit indigestible unless you've

seen it before how many people have seen

it before when no no of course you give

a lecture in another course yeah all

right like a mini lectures on it

probably by now in this I'm not in this

course I have not talked about this yet

oh the sequence of course yes we've

talked about many times I think but the

it certainly is in the lectures on wine

Mari might have been recorded because we

added loot to get me wrong it wasn't

recorded it may not have been to the

work in a different room not represent

set it up about who the next room over

yeah it's okay I hung on a casa later is

the most basic quantum mechanical system

please learn it if you want to follow

these lectures and it is you know you

can you can see where it's going we

describe particles as oscillations and

we create and annihilate particles put

them into the system take them out of

the system by mathematical operations

that are these creation and annihilation

operators so they are absolutely central

to the to the understanding of quantum

field theory and particle physics just

completely ok let's let's come back very

quickly now and I think we'll have to

discuss this again but let's come back

to this little model of a world on a

circle where we made the world finite by

making space to be a circle instead of

an infinite line and now it's a very

simple world of only one dimension but

we have this line distance around it is

L let's imagine photons or

electromagnetic radiation or whatever

kind of particles moving on this line

there are some allowable values of the

wavelength remember where the allowable

values of the wavelength are L divided

by n where n is any integer that means

there are allowable values of momentum

is there are allowable values of

frequency and allowable values of

momentum okay those allowable values of

frequency we can call Omega in

n goes from minus infinity to infinity

whatever it goes over well angles in the

puzzle sorry from zero to infinity all

the possible values of frequencies all

right the waves moving on the system

here are a collection of harmonic

oscillators one harmonic oscillator for

each value of n the each frequency of

oscillation you can add energy

independently to each frequency and you

can take any given frequency and add

energy to oscillations in that frequency

you can then add energy on top of that

with some other frequency so a system of

waves moving on a circle like this so

moving in anything for that matter is

really just a collection of harmonic

oscillators with a certain set of

allowable frequencies the question is

how do you describe this system

mathematically in quantum mechanics and

the answer is let's begin with the idea

of a state we're not going to do this in

detail now we're not actually going to

get to our first example of a quantum

field we'll get there next time but

let's work around it a little bit how

would we label the states of a system

where there are many possible where

there are many oscillators around you

can either think about this as all the

oscillations of a wave on a circle or

you can just think of it as a bunch of

balls and Springs with different

frequencies

how would you label it well each

harmonic oscillator has a quantized

energy the quantized energy for each one

of these oscillators is some integer

times Omega n times H bar so what we

have to state then is the integer

excitations of each oscillator

the number of quanta with the lowest

frequency the lowest frequency whatever

it is or in one number of quanta with

frequency in two or the second the

number of quanta with the third

frequency and so forth and on and on for

infinity forever this would correspond

to a state in which the lowest

wavelength or the longest wavelength the

longest wavelength oscillator

has in one quanta in it the next longest

wavelength oscillation would have in two

and three I'm getting a little bit tired

and I suspect you are also but what I

want you to think about is the guitar

string or the violin string and how you

how you create harmonics what we're

talking about is harmonics all right so

there's an overall mode of oscillation

of the string where it behaves up and

down like that if we forgot everything

else and just thought of this as a

simple harmonic oscillator oscillating

back and forth we could say that the

energy level of the system is just one

possibly no excitations one unit of

excitation two units of excitation three

units of excitation and how much would

each unit of excitation cost it would

cost an energy which was the frequency

of that particular note Omega times H

bar times the number of oscillations

with that frequency then we could add

additional energy in the form of the

first harmonic

all right so if if this oscillation

correspond with the middle C this

oscillation would be what the C one

knocked of above middle C or whatever

add some energy in that that has twice

the frequency twice the frequency so we

would be then adding a number of quanta

with the second frequency and then we

could add oscillations on top of that I

always have trouble drawing this next

one I can't draw it you know what I mean

three with two nodes yeah two nodes but

it would have three times the frequency

right three ways fit in that has an

oscillation like that has three times of

frequency and how many oscillators how

many quanta would we put in or we can

put any number in but that would be in

three and the entire configuration of

this oscillating string quantum

mechanically oscillating string would be

characterized by a collection of

integers which tells us how much

quantized energy there is in each mode

of oscillation so basically what we have

to do mathematically is repeat the

mathematics of the harmonic oscillator

infinitely many times one for each mode

of oscillation

the result is a quantum field that's

what a quantum field is is it's a

collection of harmonic oscillators a

collection of creation and annihilation

operators which add and subtract energy

in each mode of oscillation and it's the

mathematics of that collection of

oscillators which is called quantum

field theory so if we want to carry on

with this subject they have to get used

to this language okay

let's quit here

Wow let me just say one more thing if

we're interested in particle physics

experiments what happens in particle

physics experiments particles with given

energy momentum come in they rearrange

particles with other energy and momentum

go out so in other words we remove

particles with an eye we remove

particles from the initial state and

replace them by particles in the final

state the mathematical description of

that is to remove particles with

annihilation operators and replace them

with particles of other momenta and

energy involving other creation and

annihilation operators so that's what

these operators do they remove particles

and put particles in and the

mathematical description of the creation

and annihilation of particles is through

these kind of mathematical symbols

that's why that's so important the other

the N is used like indicate the energy

level but then it's also used indicate

the count of number of content is that

linkage is going on here one integer has

to do with the number of nodes here and

the other has to do with the number of

quanta I'll spell this out again there

are two distinct integers in this class

in this example the number of nodes

would tell you the frequency and then

the number of quanta with each frequency

so there are two three two integers

floating around

Yeah right one of them is associated

with you yeah this is hard stuff this is

not easy it's abstract it's too abstract
