Stanford University

we're going to study tonight is angular

momentum we're after is one of the most

important interesting unintuitive and

yet very very simple aspects of

elementary particles or anything else

for that matter their spin their aim

their spin angular momentum let's first

talk a little bit about what angular

momentum is well let me let me pretend

for the moment that you knew what

angular momentum was which you probably

do but you get you get a rough idea it's

got to do with how fast the system is

rotating and how massive it is and the

you know that sort of thing

angular momentum is first of all a

vector quantity a point center Direction

the mathematical definition of the

angular momentum is that its direction

as a vector points along the axis of

rotation so that's kind of obvious um

there's a right-hand rule if the system

is rotating about an axis you don't know

offhand without a definition whether the

angular momentum is pointing that way or

that way all I told you it was along the

axis so you need a rule the rule is the

right-hand rule if it's rotating that

way you wrap your fingers around the

direction of rotation and your thumb

points along the direction of the

angular momentum

that's not something you prove that's

something you define alright the

direction of angular momentum it's built

up out of the mass and the speed of

rotation and that sort of thing

the moment of inertia to be exact which

is a combination of a mass and the size

of the system and the velocity the

angular velocity and any system of any

ordinary system composite system this

cup here made up at a lots of atoms it

actually can have two kinds of angular

momentum what is called orbital angular

momentum

and the orbital angular momentum is a

consequence of the motion of its center

of mass it could be angular momentum

angular momentum first of all is

relative to a particular axis if an

object is moving around an axis it has

angular momentum relative to that axis

even if the thing is it's not itself not

spinning it's a Google Earth spinning

spinning is rotating about some internal

axis it has angular momentum by virtue

of the fact that it's moving let's say

in a circular orbit around my head I see

it that has angular momentum that's not

the angular momentum we're interested in

that orbital angular momentum the

angular momentum were interested in is

the angular momentum of spin so what

does the spin angular momentum the spin

angular momentum is what ever angular

momentum would be there in a frame of

reference where the system was at rest

so if the system is at rest the only

angle where the center of mass of the

system is at rest I don't mean that it's

not rotating I mean that its center of

mass is standing still in the frame of

reference where its momentum is zero

ordinary momentum any leftover angular

momentum is called spin basically ah now

I wish I had a basketball or something

that I could spin but just to illustrate

ordinarily in ordinary thinking about

things you can take a basketball and you

can start it rotating and you'll say

that's the same thing that's the same

object as the original basketball which

wasn't rotating except it's now rotating

if we also keep track of the fact that

in quantum mechanics the amount of

angular momentum is discrete

you can't interpolate continuously

between different angular momenta then

you could ask the question it becomes a

def question of definition

if you start an object with a little bit

with no angular momentum and then you

rotate it up you spin it up and give it

some angular momentum is it the same

object rotating or is it a new object

now that's obviously a matter of

definition but in practice the real

issue is how much energy does it take to

set it into rotation now you say I can

set it into the smallest amount of

rotation arbitrarily small amount of

rotation and so it takes arbitrarily

small amount of energy to start rotating

but that's true in classical mechanics

you have a continuous interpolation

between the thing not rotating and the

thing rotating but in quantum mechanics

you don't have a continuous

interpolation and so I would say it's a

matter of definition whether you want to

think of a rotating nucleus as the same

object or a discretely different object

but the real question as I said is how

much energy does it take the starter

system in rotation given that the

rotational States are discrete it makes

sense how much task how much energy does

it take to set it into the first excited

state the first lowest amount of

rotation that you can get if it's very

small it only takes a little bit of

energy then the object is probably

pretty recognizable as the same object

as when it was rest but if it takes an

enormous amount of energy well it could

take so much amount of so much energy

that it would just blow the system apart

so for example an atom if you try to set

an atom into rotation with too much

angular momentum the electrons will just

fly off and that atom won't even be

there so you certainly make things which

are distinguished ibly different when

you set them into rotation

and discreetly different what about an

electron can you set an electron forget

for the moment that the electron has

intrinsic spin for a minute let's forget

that for a minute

can you set an electron into rotation so

that it resembles the same object except

rotating about some axis or is the

electron somehow so small and so point

like that it doesn't make any sense to

set it into rotation a thing which is

infinitely small a simple point a simple

mathematical point it's hard to conceive

of at least with our usual mental

pictures of setting that thing into

rotation but we don't know that the

electron is infinitely small maybe the

electron is not infinitely small ah if

it's not infinitely small maybe we have

a chance of seeing a rotating electron

so the question becomes how much energy

does it take to set an electron into

rotation now the answer tends to depend

on the size of an object for a given

mass it depends on the size of an object

surprisingly maybe it's surprising maybe

it's not surprising the smaller the

object the more energy it takes to set

it into rotation big objects you can set

into very very small angular velocities

small objects take larger amounts of

energy to excite them to a given amount

of rotations or given amount of angular

momentum the electron may be so small

and it probably is it's known to be so

small that the energy that it would take

to give it one more unit of angular

momentum would be astronomical would be

maybe the Planck energy or some

humongously large energy and so we don't

see in the laboratory rotating electrons

in fact the rotating electron may be so

different from an ordinary electron that

we wouldn't even call it

electrons are the upside of this is that

when we talk about objects in quantum

mechanics we are or particles in

particular are nuclei are any simple

systems relatively simple systems they

have a amount of angular momentum which

characterizes them and which once and

for all is fixed you don't talk about

electrons with different angular it's

different spin angular momentum the

angular momentum of the electron is

always the same if it has any angular

momentum at all you say why is that well

just because if it had more angular

momentum you call it a different object

now angular momentum as I said is a

vector we're going to define exactly

what I have defined at the moment but

it's a vector it has a length the length

of the vector is proportional to the

speed of rotation and so forth it can

point in any direction or at least

classically it can point in any

direction shall we think of pointing the

angular momentum of an object in

different directions as corresponding to

different objects let's suppose we now

do have an object which has some angular

momentum we call it what should we call

it I don't want to call it an electron

it's a what spin transparent okay

spintronics pintron we identified as a

spin Tron and its angular momentum is

pointing that way can the angular

momentum point in another direction well

yes it better be able to because the

laws of physics are rotationally

invariant there's nothing special about

one axis than another axis so yes the

same object can be made to rotate in a

different direction even if it can't be

made to rotate with more total angular

momentum so pointing it in different

directions we would say corresponds to

the same object if an electron does have

angular momentum

anthem we should be able to think of

that angular momentum in any direction

on the other hand the amount of angular

momentum the magnitude of it is

quantized and so as I said the gap to

the first excited state of the electron

may be so large that we wouldn't even

call it an electron okay so the angular

momentum can point in any direction it

is quantized and now we have to enter

into the theory of angular momentum

tonight what we're going to do is the

mathematics of angular momentum and it's

very magical it's magical and it seems

totally abstract totally unintuitive and

then pop out comes experimental facts

and predictions and the entire

properties of spin as an experimental

observational fact about particles

all right let's yeah question okay do

you know what they know at the moment of

inertia of an object is okay let me

answer the question the simplest it is

kind of intuitive a little bit well

isn't it isn't the moment of inertia is

a combination of the the mass of the

object and the radius of the object we

take a ball of some sort all right it's

M R squared now it depends on the

detailed shape of the object and it

depends on how the matter is distributed

sometimes it's three three-halves mr

squared you know but it's a boarder mr

squared and it's called the moment of

inertia I okay the energy of a rotating

object we're four that's one thing now

then there is the angular momentum the

angular momentum of the object is made

up if the object let's say the outer

boundary

the object let's say is moving with

velocity V and then roughly speaking

order magnitude the mass times the

velocity that's the ordinary momentum of

a piece of it mass times velocity and if

you multiply that by our that's that's

the angular momentum momentum times

distance is angular momentum so the

momentum of of a little piece of it

times the distance from the center of it

is the angular momentum and if you write

down the kinetic energy the kinetic

energy is one-half MV squared what

you'll discover is that it's the angular

momentum squared divided by the moment

of inertia twice the moment of inertia

to be exact

so that's the energy the kinetic energy

of rotation is the angular momentum

squared divided by twice the moment of

inertia now for a given mass let's say

the mass of the electron the smaller it

is the smaller the moment of inertia but

the moment of inertia goes in the

denominator and that means the amount of

energy that it takes to increase the

angular momentum by one unit is

inversely proportional to the square of

the size of the object okay so it's a

classical mechanical fact the only thing

that comes new in quantum mechanics is

that the angular momenta is discrete or

discrete but the fact that for a given

angular momentum a smaller object cost

more energy that's a classical

mechanical fact

okay let's are let's do some of the

mathematics and tonight we're really

going to do the mathematics of angular

momentum it's both totally unintuitive

and simple all right simple enough and

this is a great example of where you see

extremely abstract mathematics which you

can follow suddenly popping out

very unintuitive answers but

nevertheless experimental answers

alright let's let's begin well first of

all let's begin with a single particle

orbiting a center circular orbit for

simplicity the angular momentum is the

momentum of the particle times the

distance from the origin mass times

velocity times distance but we'll just

call it momentum that's the angular

momentum in this very simple context R

is it positive or is it negative that

depends on the sense of rotation going

this way I think I'll call positive

going that way I'll call negative but

it's not very important that's the

angular momentum of a point object now

this object has momentum has angular

momentum because it has momentum and it

has momentum because it has velocity so

this is not yet spin but now supposing

we had two particles at opposite ends of

the diameter here both going with the

same sense of rotation now the center of

mass would be at rest the center of mass

of the system would be at rest but the

angular momentum would certainly not be

zero it would be the sum of the two

angular momenta and they're going in the

same direction so here's an example

where the center of mass of the system

can be at rest but there's still angular

momentum this is spin okay alright now

let's get a little more refined in our

precise definition of angular momentum I

said before angular momentum is a vector

and that means or that's denoted by

putting a little arrow over the top of

it

momentum is a vector and also spatial

location is the spatial location of an

object it is relative to an origin

relative to an origin we can call it a

vector it's the radial vector

let's talk about the components first

before we get on to an angular momentum

the components of the R vector are just

the coordinates of the position of the

particle so the components of R this R

over here let's write it over here the

components of our are just x y and z x

y&z being the coordinates of the

position of the particle and I'm also

going to sometimes call them X 1 X 2 and

X 3 X 3 being Z X to being Y X 1 being X

ok so we have these two vectors and

somehow the angular momentum is a

product of the two vectors the angular

momentum is itself a vector how do you

make a vector out of two vectors by

multiple by multiplication what kind of

rule of multiplication is there that

takes two vectors and combines them

together by some rule of multiplication

to make a new vector that is only that's

right there's only one rule there's only

one such rule and that's the cross

product the cross product R and in fact

there's an ambiguity is it R cross P or

P cross R that's a question of whether

you're right-handed or left-handed do

you use the right hand rule or the left

hand rule the standard convention is

that it's R cross P I don't remember I

think it's right here a bit it's

left-handed I'm not sure I don't

remember we could figure it out but I

don't want to yeah

it's R cross P oh we labeled the

coordinates of the R vector is also the

P vector the P vector also has

coordinates and it's coordinates are px

py and PZ or p1 p2 p3 okay those

that's that's the notation we'll use now

I can ask what are the components of the

angular momentum so for that all you

have to know is how to build a

cross-product and I'll assume everybody

knows that build a cross-product so

let's just do it here's the rule the X

component of the cross-product the X

component of the angular momentum is the

Y component of position times the Z

component of momentum minus the Z

component of position times the y

component of momentum this is the only

one that I ever remember L x equals y

times PZ all right I read that off the

other one here I know that I have to put

them in the upper I have to change PZ to

Z P y 2y and then I want to go down from

there LX ly and LZ I never remember them

but I know the rule the rule is you just

cycle from X to Y to Z and back to X 2 y

2 Z think of XY and Z as being our

points on a clock and you go from one to

the next so when you go from X to Y Y

goes to Z Z goes to X let's go down to

the next one y Z X this is not I'm not

finished with the formula Z X Y py minus

xpz minus our Y P X the only reason I

emphasize the cycling is to keep track

of the sign how do I know that L Y isn't

XP z minus z PX ok that's the rule you

cycle through that way and right that's

the component of angular momentum of a

point particle moving in the vicinity of

some origin of coordinates right it's

the orbital angular momentum of that

particle is not the spin angular

momentum

to make a spin angular momentum for a

system of ordinary in classical

mechanics to make a spin angular

momentum you've got to have a lot of

particles at least two anyway I showed

you how to make a spin angular momentum

with two of them you have to have

several particles to being a possible

all right how do you build the angular

momentum or composite system you just

add the angular momenta as vectors you

add them as vectors you add the angular

momentum of all the constituents once

you add the angular momentum then you

can have a spin where the total momentum

is equal to zero but the angular

momentum is not equal to zero but this

is the basic formula for a single

indivisible point particle so and as I

said you just add them up for for a lot

of particles next step we want to do the

quantum mechanics of angular momentum

this is the classical mechanics actually

it's also the quantum mechanics but to

get to the quantum mechanics the basic

mathematics of quantum mechanics is the

quantum mechanics of operators all

quantities of physical significance

meaning to say things that you can

observe measure all those things are

represented in quantum mechanics by what

operators emission operators operators

and there's no special exception about

angular momenta the components of

angular momenta are may are represented

by operators but to figure out what

those operators are all we really need

to know is what the operators which

represent the position and momentum are

in fact we don't even really have to

know very much about the detailed

property of the position and momentum

operators all we have to know is their

commutation relations with their

commutation relations that's all we need

to know in order to carry on and work

out everything

okay so what what does it mean what are

the implications of two operators

commuting let's suppose I have two

operators which represent two observable

quantities the anus and the Venus of a

system and I know that a and B commute

what does that tell me about observation

yeah exactly

you can simultaneously measure them what

if they don't commute hmm then you can't

simultaneously measure them the most

famous example of two things that you

cannot simultaneously measure of course

is position and momentum the implication

is that in quantum mechanics the

operator is representing whether I erase

them P 1 P 2 P 3 on the one hand x1 x2

and x3 don't commute among themselves so

what are the write commutation relations

alright now to some extent these are

postulates of quantum mechanics you find

them in the first chapter of Dirac's

book and they're basically postulates if

you like but there there are limitations

on what you can write down but we're

going to take them as postulates all

right the first postulate is that you

can simultaneously measure all three

coordinates of position there's no

limitation on how well you can determine

the x y&z coordinates of position

they're all simultaneously measurable

and the implication of that is that

every X commutes with every every other

X we can write that down X I XJ equals 0

for all I and J for all I and J

incidentally anything commutes with

itself would be very weird or something

didn't commute with itself that would

say you can measure it but you couldn't

measure it simultaneously with itself

that idea okay so everything commutes

with itself

same thing for momenta there is no

limitation on being able to

simultaneously measure the different

and some momentum so p i pj equals zero

what about X's with P so that's exactly

what the uncertainty principle is about

it tells us that we cannot

simultaneously measure coordinates in

position but which coordinates in which

positions can which components can we

not measure simultaneously and the

answer there's not a lot of freedom

about this but nevertheless I'm going to

just state it as a postulate that X 1

and P 2 can be simultaneously measured

the x coordinate of a particle and the y

component of its momentum are not

limited by the uncertainty principle

it's the X component of position in the

X component of momentum which are not

simultaneously measurable so we have

that X with P X is not equal to 0

anybody remember what it is equal to IH

bar it's small why because we certainly

don't expect macroscopic big heavy

objects to behave with such bizarre

behaviors so it's small one unit of

angular momentum

sorry one unit of Planck's constant ah

and so forth for y&z and so we can write

down a general formula that the

commutator of X I with PJ is IH bar if I

equals J and it's 0 if I doesn't equal J

is that clear

ok so to represent that we put the

Kronecker Delta here and that's a nice

systematic way to describe the

properties of position and momentum that

turns out all to be all we really need

to know in order to

in order to understand the properties of

angular momentum in order to understand

the properties of spin let's say there's

one other point that is worth

emphasizing that's that angular momentum

has units of Planck's constant how do I

know that

well angular momentum has units of

distance times momentum

here's distance times momentum on the

right-hand side is Planck's constant it

also occurs of course in the uncertainty

principle Delta X Delta P is greater

than or equal to whatever some number

times Planck's constant so you see that

Planck's constant has units of length

times momentum and angular momentum has

units of length times momentum so it's

not completely surprising that angular

momentum is quantized in units of

Planck's constant are units of the basic

quantum in nature which is Planck's

constant okay but there really we

haven't gotten ready yet I just pointed

that out what I want to work out for you

is the commutation relations of the

components of angular momentum we're

going to find out that once we work out

the commutation relations of the angular

momenta components of the angular

momentum we can forget this we won't

need it anymore it's just the components

of the angular momentum whose

commutation relations we want all right

so let's do it over here let's first

compute the commutator of LX with ly

it's not very hard I will have to wing

it a little bit because I haven't I

would have to remind you what all the

rules about the algebraic rules of

commutator ZAR but it's pretty simple

it's simple enough that the that you can

see what happens all right so we want

the commutator of LX with ly LX with ly

is Y PZ is the commutator of ypz minus

zpy

that's the first

our entry into the commutator we're

going to commute that with that was that

was LX with ly which is zpx minus xpz I

think in the last 24 hours I've done

this three times on the blackboard first

the first two times are last night when

the 30 people who fail the course showed

up late yeah but you can actually just

cycle from left to right so why start

you see si starts with a good however

you like yeah yeah that's fine right

okay let's see if we can figure this out

let's see Y PZ let's look at the

commutator of this term of the first

factor with this term of the second

factor there's nothing to prevent Y you

know when you think about commutator is

you're thinking about pushing operators

through each other can they freely pass

through each other without a change in

the value of the operator all right now

Y commutes with X so it can go like past

X it also compute the commutes with P Z

PZ commutes with X and PZ commutes with

P Z so you can push this one right

through this one no obstruction so these

two commute with each other

contribute nothing to the commutator I

think there's another combination let's

see is it this one Z yeah these two what

yeah these two also commute with each

other the two it's don't commute with

each other or two pairs listen this and

this with this

so let's see if we can work it out um we

have y pz z PX the only thing which

doesn't commute here is P Z with Z all

right so I maintain that the answer is

just y times I don't want to use red is

just y times PX and it doesn't matter

which order you write them down y times

PX and then there's the commutator of P

Z with Z what's the commutator of P Z

with Z minus IH bar why is it minus IH

bar because commentators in the opposite

order change sign commutator is

anti-symmetric meaning when you change

the order of what you write in the

bracket it changes sign a B minus B a if

you interchange B it would just change

sign all right so this this commutator

of P Z with Z is minus IH bar all right

then we have this guy over here with

this one over here what is it that

doesn't commute here P Y and X commute

there's a plus minus times minus is plus

a py times X but then we have the

commutator of Z with PZ

and that's IH bar so I h-bar of IH bar

or in other words the whole thing oh

sorry

what I write that piece of Lackey very

different piece of Y right X peaceful X

piece of Y and again in each of these

expressions here it doesn't matter which

way you order the two constituent

operators here ok the whole thing then

is IH bar X py awareness wire

Obata mumbo jumbo but that was very

effective

xq minus ypx is LZ so we've learned that

the commutator of LX with ly is just

sorry IH bar I h-bar LZ that's kind of

pretty that when you commute two

components of the angular momentum you

get back another component of angular

momentum you don't have to remember

anything about peas and X's anymore the

commutation relations of angular momenta

closed among themselves and the algebra

is going to call this the algebra of

angular momentum is something abstract

which doesn't even really remember where

it came from

meaning to say that doesn't contain the

P is an exercise that's LX with ly then

in the cycling vertically or

horizontally doesn't matter to the write

down next one a wide with LZ I h-bar LLC

and so that's what x YC y z x IH r l TL

y okay those are those are fundamental

of relationships on which the theory of

angular momentum is built

now the next factor each I will tell you

is that if you have many particles and

you add up the angular momenta and then

commute them you'll find exactly the

same relationship it doesn't matter that

this was a single particle could be many

particles and it could be many particles

in your own rest frame in the rest frame

of the

center of mass so this will also be the

commutation relations for the components

of spin angular momentum so these as I

said are our starter point ah you might

ask is there anything special about the

choice of axes chose the x or y and z

axis but i never told you what x y&z

were it could be the the edges of the

room or they could be as you wanted to

use a diagonal direction two other funny

diagonal directions as long as they're

mutually perpendicular they form a

perfectly good Cartesian coordinate

system giving the components of a vector

in one frame of reference you can

commute compute them in any other frame

of reference so in principle we can work

out from this the commutation relations

of the components of angular momentum in

some other set of axes what we would

find is that they have exactly the same

form they will have exactly the same

form of I chose prime Vaccines axes

which are different I was just put some

primer in other words the commutation

relations of angular momentum are

rotationally invariant they take the

same form in every frame of reference

and that guarantees that whatever theory

were making of angular momentum it will

it will be independent the observable

facts will be independent of what axis

we choose to do the mathematics the farm

is it infinite of translation as well it

is but it is it is the spin spin spin

they'll spinning but certainly this much

is quite independent of direction is

voltage it's also yes it is also

independent of rod translation

okay next step now we're going to be now

we're going to be doing the abstract

algebra okay Magic Mike we need to

borrow so far good so far we didn't get

anything yet it's only because magic

will you get alright you can do you know

you can write down into a number of

formulas you can get a computer you can

plug in these rules into a computer and

then have it grind out all possible

theorems you can do that and mostly

they'll grind out uninteresting theorem

it becomes magic when all of a sudden

you look back and you say wow that's an

experimental fact that I can confirm or

that's telling me something interesting

about the physics of the operational

process of measurement so we'll get

there but we're still just doing

abstract mathematics for the moment of

course I know where I'm going

you don't know where I'm going so you

just have to follow out after you see it

you'll know and then you could do it

yourself some you know okay XYZ axes

that you choose are spinning alright

that's it that we don't want to do that

we don't want to do we want to use

inertial reference fighters and spinning

reference frames I'm not a vertical

nevertheless I will tell you it's still

true but the

we don't want to get into that at the

moment certainly the angular momentum is

not invariant under going to rotating

frames of reference if we have a system

which is spinning in a handsome spin

wheel into a rotating frame of reference

which come with it then it wouldn't look

like it had any angular momentum so it's

clear that that we don't want to go to

rotating frames of reference or at least

the angular momentum might be invariant

to inertial frames of reference

reference frames which most in tropical

horses know Coriolis forces and so forth

are now we're going to invent two new

operators which are very simply related

to these simple as possible they called

L plus and minus or to it let's write it

down L plus in R minus L plus is equal

at LX plus i ly and L minus is equal to

LX of - ily now today right now what

these are these are raising and lowering

operators analogous for the harmonic

oscillator creation and annihilation

operators they take an angular momentum

along a given axis namely the z axis and

they bulk you up a step and they bump

you down the step what we're going to

show that we will show that another

definition is that immeasurable values

of LZ we're going to be concentrating on

LC there is nothing special about the z

axis but the other hand is nothing to

forbid me from focusing on the z axis

nothing special about it nevertheless I

wish to choose an axis

to work with which is the z-axis I'm

going to call the eigenvalues of LZ the

measureable values that can take on I'm

going to call them n times H bar H bar

is just a number if we set H bar equal

to one which I think I will do now

because I will never on the blackboard

in real time be able to keep track of

all the H bars later on you can put it

back

LZ is just called in that's a historical

notation M as I said is the angular

momentum in units of H bar okay so it's

but and it'll turn out to be a quantized

variable okay called in historical

reasons that I don't know and that's a

rotational use what I want to calculate

I'm not interested for our purposes in

the commutator between LX l plus ml -

I'll tell you if you want to work it out

it's proportional to LZ but don't that's

not our interest right now I want to

work out a commutator of L plus with LZ

you'll see why is we go along all right

so we want L plus 1 LZ

also it'll - what LZ but let's do L plus

what else this is equal to commutator of

LX plus iy with LZ really how old rules

this is easy

oh my god we're going to do with them

here they are

how many dator of LX with LZ can

somebody read it off for me

- my idol - al lime is sitting H bar

equal to 1 from the right so LX with LZ

- I believe you I do - i ly

[Music]

and what about what about ly with LC so

there's plus I and now know why with LC

maybe we did or 9ln ILX that's I squared

L X and I squared is just minus 1 and

this is just equal to minus L plus all

right it's - LX plus ily okay so we have

our first commutation relation I think I

can get rid of this it's just minus L

plus what about L - what LZ I won't drag

you through it I'll just write down the

answer

oh I think the answer is plus L - when

you compute when you commute L plus 1 LZ

you get back our plus when you compute

when you community now - what LZ you get

back l - with a sign that depends on

whether it's L plus RL - these are the

basic commutation relations that we've

invited ok the next step is I want to

show that L plus + l - are bumping

operators which bump you up and down

like raising a lower like creation and

annihilation operators for harmonic

oscillators now when L + NL - act they

change the Z component of angular

momentum so we're going to focus measure

we can only measure one component

the angular momentum and at or if you

say that did I say don't say right now

how many of the components of angular

momentum can be simultaneously measure

which is one any two of them both

community any two of them don't commute

and so at most we can measure one

component of angular momentum at a time

we pick one direction we call it the

quantization axis but there's nothing

special about it

focus on it and though we interested now

in the possible values that LZ can take

on in other words was the possible

values of him and what we're going to do

now is we're going to show that L plus

bumps you up in M increases the

eigenvalue m by one year so let's see if

we can do that let's suppose we have a

state let's call it m such that LZ

acting on him is equal to what an

environment in other words that little m

is an eigen value of LZ with eigenvector

ket vector M that's what it means to say

that m is an eigenvalue we don't have

been through this a number of times what

we want to prove is that if you act with

L Plus on and that's a new vector let's

put a red box around it it's a new it's

a new ket vector what I want to prove is

if that's a ket vector with eigenvalue n

plus 1 with eigenvalue of l z equal to n

plus 1 so let's do it all we have to do

is multiply this by LZ and see what we

get what should we get if it really is

an eigenvector

get some more we should get n plus 1

in terms the same thing in the red box

we should get I won't bother writing it

down but we should get n plus 1 times of

thing in the red box alright now this

would be easy to compute if L plus if LZ

commuted with L plus then we would just

push the LZ through and use the fact

that LZ on em just gives us M fudging

okay that would be easy but it's not

that easy we can't push LZ through L

plus y because they don't commute but if

we use the commutation relations we can

so I'll try it out what this commutation

relation means it means L plus LZ - LZ l

plus equals of minus L plus written it

out by hand in excruciating detail the

thing that I'm interested in here thing

that came up here was LZ x l+ so let's

put that on one side of the equation and

write that this is L plus LZ plus L plus

of style 0 plus equals L ZL plus that's

what I want

LZ l plus with LZ on the left of plus on

the right ok and here I have it on the

left side of the equation we'll see is a

useful we're going to find out what is

useful so this is equal then 2l plus LZ

acting on n plus L plus acting on it

I'll stop here if there any questions I

think I've been clear but if not though

ok but now it's easy

what is LZ with an X on it can just

replaces the LZ by an M right so let's

take an amount put the M over here pick

out the cells it

close it up a little bit and x l+ and

here we just have L plus tangent what

did I do with that I know we're going to

do with it but we just up oh we can do

it is put a red box around it l plus x m

l+ arms in same red box same thing in

the red box on each side so what's in

the red box as the property that L 1 LZ

hits it and multiplies it by n plus 1 in

the red box is an eigenvector of LZ with

eigenvalue m plus 1 that's a little bit

of magic and what it tells us is that if

we have a state with a given value of LZ

there must be another state with one

additional unit of LZ in other words you

could bump up LZ by one unit um you can

bump down LZ the same way except using

the lowering operator so you can check

that that L minus our M gives you an

eigenvector with eigenvalue in - water

let's another let's think about now we

learned something rather non-trivial

we've discovered the spectrum of angular

momentum with Z component that IV lemon

right good is spaced by integers

here is the spectrum of angular momentum

and whatever it is it's spaced by

integers I didn't know it could be I

don't know it's spectrum of angular

momentum is yet expecting the possible

values of it it could be pi PI plus 1 PI

plus 2 pi plus 3 PI minus 1 PI minus 2

or be the square root 2 2 plus 1 squared

2 plus 2 whatever they are the gap by

integers but we still don't know what

they are

anyone ah yeah we'll come to that okay

now next question and it's all running

on forever now remember we're talking

about a particular particle we're

talking about Carlos we're not talking

about the whole world we're just talking

about some particular elementary

particle what's a neutron or not or even

a nucleus how much can we bump up the

angular momentum the Z component of

angular momentum before it's not the

same object anymore before we simply run

out of possibilities so we're talking

about an object let's think classically

from an ad it's rotating about some axis

and we're not allowed to increase the

rate of rotation that would give us a

new object at different objects but we

are not allowed to rotate the angular

momentum around and rotate the angular

momentum but we're not allowed to

increase its amount without changing the

whole nature of the object okay so

there's no way of saying it

that is a given length or given value of

l squared the magnitude of L is fixed

the magnitude of L is fixed and it

characterizes the particle this is a

particle is characterized by mass it's

also characterized by own length of the

angular momentum vector of LEF square of

the length of the angular momentum

vector okay how do we maximize the Z

component of angular momentum we simply

point it though we simply point the

object upward you point the spin axis

okay and that's going to be the maximum

angular momentum Z maximum Z component

of the angular momentum so how many to

the point of view there ought to be a

maximum value for the angular momentum

of a specific article accomplice and

after that mother well how can that be

how can it be we've already proved that

by acting with L Plus we bump up the

angular momentum how can they possibly

be a ceiling for the to the rule the

answer is exactly the same as the

harmonic oscillator creation and

annihilation operators remember what

happens to the annihilation operator if

you hit the bottom state the state of

lowest energy it just gives you zero

okay that's the one possibility we left

out here that perhaps there are states

or a state where L Plus will give zero

that would have to be the case if there

was a max

manual momentum so for the maximum

angular momentum if there is such a

thing there is for every given object l+

on let's call em max must equal zero so

the curl can't go past a certain point

what about the minimum value of the

angular momentum minimum means the one

keep this down the summer Megan it

better just be the negative of this why

must it be the negative why couldn't it

be something else that's just rotational

invariance if you can build a system

with an angular momentum of only given

axis of a certain value you must be able

by rotational invariance by every axis

being equivalent every other axis you

must be able to rotate that on your

momentum and have exactly the same value

except pointing in the opposite

direction so the bottom must be of

course in Max and min must be equal to

minus M max it was in name and then of

course being negative and from a maximum

in we can bump up an integer or bump

bearing integer and then that now fixes

for us some properties of a spectrum

it's got to be symmetrically located

relative to 0 and it's got to be gapped

or spaced by integers there's only two

possibilities of think about for a few

minutes there's only two possibilities

well there's many possibilities but they

come in two families the first in the

first family zero is a possible value of

M this is M equals zero and then M

equals one

everyone's minus one and so forth until

you get the hem max and until you get

the M near and max slap laptop welcome

and thanks - I'm max how many such

states are there all together - and Max

+ 1 and Max here and Max here and then

one more at the origin twice and Max was

born that's the number of possible

states because I haven't told you what

I'm excerpts but that's because M max

could be anything

depending on the specific particle or

the specific object we're talking about

so specific particles have their own

value of M Max and that in Max is called

the spin of the particle for example

there are particles that have no spin at

all then the spectrum of angular

momentum is just M equals 0 and nothing

else when you hit with a raising

operator you get zero are you hit with a

lower number and you get zero that's

spin zero then there's the possibility

of spin 1 spin 1 is a situation where M

equals 1 is the ceiling and N equals

minus 1 is the floor can't go below the

floor can't Corbeau the ceiling that's

spin one or the spin one particle you

cannot split two particles have spin

three particles and so for example the

Higgs boson is a spin zero particle the

photon has been one particle and Z

bosons has been one particle are there's

been two particles in nature

well the graviton

- particle about spin three particles no

object that is ordinarily called an

elementary particles spin three but

there are certainly objects with spin

free there are nuclei with spin three

there are basketballs with spin three

there are galaxies who spin three rather

hard finding but yeah there are lots of

objects with string three but among the

elementary particles in nature the

things that we ordinarily call the

electric particles spin zero spin one

instance Pig goes in now that's not

completely clear because I missed the

possibility the possibility was that N

equals zero was not going to spectrum

the only other situation which is

symmetrical about the vertical and which

is gapped by integers based by integers

as / 0 over here is to start at N equals

1/2 and M equals minus 1/2 and then go

upward in units of 1 so this one would

be three halves is going to be minus

three halves and so forth until you come

to a max in this case only all the

eigenvalues would be half integers the

simplest example being just the half

spin particle again you call you use the

you describe the particle as having a

spin equal to the maximum value so an

object which only had spin 1/2 or Z

component equal to 1/2 and minus 1/2

that's the simplest object with the half

spin kind of spectrum that's called a

half spin particle mmm the next one will

be called spin free halves particle and

spin 5 halves particle the particles

come in these two types integer spin and

heritage

better requests don't know yes a bit

HEPA the string and integer spender

yeah yeah yeah but the only thing is

system that the maximum is going to be a

half integer it's going to be non

integer it's been three halfs particle

the maximum would be three halves

it's been five halves particle for

spending maximum 200

oh yeah in all speculations about

elementary particles basically a

combination of Lorentz invariants

quantum mechanics and fusing other

things tell you that there are no

particles elementary particles has been

higher than true that will allow 0 1 & 2

and it will allow a half and three

halves so all the standard particles of

elementary particle physics are 0 1/2 1

3 halves into but you can build

composite objects yo the your liner

loves or neighbors and guys well it is

things is just it just means rotated

around the access just pointed down and

we characterize particle by the maximum

value that's been meaning the maximum

positive value so let me he'll and a way

out of here so okay i acquire there only

say two orientations who said there to

spin one zero particle or none okay to

screen three particle there are three I

[Applause]

know what you're asking

you're asking what happens to the

directions in between your ass yeah okay

we're going to talk about that that's

where quantum that's quantum mechanics

in your face

yeah we will compare that's not what

topic of all okay when we ask for more

really after that and you get different

uptick which is good I like corkscrew a

corkscrew motion is a motion which is

moving and rotating we an

electromagnetic wave can be a corkscrew

way yeah

meaning the circular polarization

circularly polarized wave has a heard

many all are is all or now very

classical yeah yeah yeah but

nevertheless a circularly polarized

photon is one with a spin angular

momentum along the axis going exactly

the direction of U vector a circularly

polarized wave is composed of circularly

polarized photons and a circularly

polarized means one whose

angular momentum along that axis is

pointing along that axis but to talk

about to talk about objects at rest

which is what we're talking about now it

doesn't make sense to talk about

corkscrew motion because both crew

really has to do with simultaneous

rotation and motion along an axis so at

the moment the object you're hunting for

the mathematical term is he listening

olicity is got to do with the

orientation of the spinning relative to

the direction of motion a little contact

very very important cause your element a

particle that we know this rehab stick

ah depends on whether way to find the

terminal

no electronic measure or that we have

areas or punches like a simple arm it's

a matter of speculations populations to

to roam work conjecture it's a matter of

conjecture that there exists a

supersymmetric particle partner of the

graviton which is called the gravity

know which has been perhaps that has not

and will never be experiment we love

this if you use that parity parity

Hector directly at this point the elves

are no longer acting like the original

definition because if you just further

or at their original definition in you

wouldn't get these limits so there isn't

much be a difference well it looks like

there's no longer acting on the original

space of the side functions that we had

somehow there's an aside mentions of the

original space of X no we didn't know

what the original space of catch was we

didn't know what you're right okay well

if this what we're doing is the

properties of that space okay that's

what we're doing we didn't know what

they were here thanks it's not the UH

face that we usually take in Frank's L

got your honor no no this is something

new so nice in space you can tell us

what the spices oh it is a space of

these integers that's it for a particle

of spin in the space is that the basis

vectors or you specify what a state is

by saying where the basis vectors are

its basis vectors are simply labeled

with the values

and along this ackers that's it that's

that's uh yeah if you took the absolute

value about that vector now is that is

that an observable quantity and would

you get this it is so let's let's

alright so let me tell you what's true

[Music]

okay instead of the absolute value let's

take the sums of the squares of the

components and see what we can find out

about that I try to do with other notes

let's take l squared you might think

that l squared is just M max squared so

that would make sense right you you you

pick this spinning you point it directly

upward the problem with that is that you

can't know the Z component and the x and

y component simultaneously so if you

know the edge of the Z component is

vertically upward and max there's bound

to be some uncertainty in the x and y

component all right so that uncertainty

in X & Y component will tell you that LX

squared plus a y squared plus LZ squared

not quite be and mass squared will have

a little extra so what's computing

that's a fun thing to compute them

that's that I was going to go without my

notes because always one thing which I

have to go through to remember yeah okay

let's take L square l squared means LX

squared plus ly squared plus LZ squared

and of course the name of the game here

is to rewrite things in terms of L plus

L minus L see L plus L minus n LZ are so

was L squared let's start with Elma all

right so what would we do to get l

squared we would add LZ squared and that

would be it right classically but not

quite true quantum mechanically because

this is extra commutator term the extra

commutator term else

plus L minus is not equal exactly to LX

square plus ly squared it's in fact LX

squared plus a y squared plus a term

coming from the commutator of LX with or

without LX with ly so let me write down

what that extra term is what's the

commutator of LX with ly it's got to do

with LZ there's an eye over here but the

commutator also has an R in it so the

eyes are going to cancel and if you work

it out you find out that it's just plus

L that else well let's see that Jen L

plus L minus is LX square plus ly

squared I think it's - LZ and that means

that l squared has another term in it

which is just plus LZ

it's definitely plus over here because -

just an extra term coming from that

commutator the little mistake we made

when we said that L owe that L plus

times L minus is LX squared plus L R

squared give a little mistake and a

little mistake is proportional LZ and

here's how it comes in okay now let's

take L square and operate on a state

which is M max which has the maximum

eigen value of M what are we get L

square root of that is equal to L minus

L plus on in Max Plus what do I get with

it when L Z gets in max

incident in MX so here we get plus n max

squared plus M max times the ket vector

M max what about this I went through all

this effort but still left with

something out of the one bit but I don't

know what it is because L plus when it

hits and Max has nowhere to go

all right we reached the ceiling

this is zero so what have we found out

we found out that the eigenvalue of l

squared for the state up here is just in

max squared plus M X in other words in

max times M max plus one in next time in

max plus one but a mask with M max comes

in nights squared plus classically it

would just be a max squared the maximum

value but because of the fluctuation

because of the uncertainty principle

which says the things which don't

commute can simultaneously be specified

there's got to be some fluctuation in

them and that fluctuation manifests

itself by a little shift here okay so

let's take the case for example of a

spin zero particles

what is the l squared for a spin zero

particles wow that's not interesting and

Max is zero in that case this is zero

good what about a spin one particle

[Music]

turns out to be two what about spin 1/2

particle 1/2 times three-halves there's

3/4 so for a spin what about a spin

thousand particle

well yeah yes right if index is big

enough the Schnoodle shift is not

important

yeah we take a spin of a hundred billion

billion billion we're just going to get

a square of it plus a tiny irrelevant

change so classically it's a very good

approximation that l squared is just an

X now if you worked out you can do this

you can work out l squared on each one

of these states and you'll get the same

value all of these states have the same

value of l squared that is the quantum

mechanical error of the statement that

when you rotate the particle to change

its Z component of angular momentum

it just doesn't change the square it

doesn't change the magnitude of it so

that's a little exercise you could work

out using again just the commutation

relations of the angular momentum can

you know the square of the angular

momentum and the Z component

simultaneously yes you can and you can

check that by computing the commutator

of l squared with the individual

component to the angular momentum what

you'll find is a commutator of l squared

with any one of the components is equal

to zero so that means although you

cannot know two components of the

angular momentum simultaneously you can

know a component and the total squared

value of the angular member every

electron has a squared spirit the spin

angular momentum equal to 3/4 every

electron is the same value and it

doesn't matter which play way the

electron is oriented

you said today would spin 1/2 L square

root of e 0 crawls or justice your case

no L squared is 0 for the zeros okay 0

only has one state with collegia

movement measures N equals 1 square its

to it 1 times 1 plus 1 right right

if I spin 3 what is it L times L plus 1

is 3 times 4

well he said that yeah I probably see

how that it's always the same no matter

which level you oh that's meant to work

out so how do you work out your when you

work it out by saying let me take em max

and now hit it without - this gives me

in that excuse me the next one and then

hit it with l squared and use the tricks

use the algebraic trick tricks and so

that when you hit with l squared it just

gives you the same idea value the same

is our trivia algebraic statement is

that l squared on the thing in the red

box get your red box around the vector

if you're asking that this is equal this

is in that this is equal to M max prime

n max plus one necklace I am axe and

men's dress and that's plus one times

the thing in the red box

all right the l squared is exactly the

same eigenvalue as it had firm x itself

yeah you get that from the girl over

there you get that from manipulating the

operators you get that from manipulating

operators you use yeah you use this

formula here and manipulative and fiddle

around with it darling and yup it takes

it takes a few minutes work it also

follows from the fact that l squared

commutes with l plus an L minus commutes

with all the components of the angular

Momentum's of computers commutes with l

fussing on - and it just follows through

that

so yeah they all have the same squared

angular now let's talk about the

rotational invariance not in detail not

gonna talk about the details that would

be great over time but we seem to have

nothing but some discrete states of

angular momentum along the z-axis

what about rotating that ah if we

rotated it wouldn't we get angular

momenta which had fractional value along

the z axis and maybe some components in

the other direction so Aladdin let's

let's concentrate for simplicity on the

spinning up case from spin 1/2 case the

spin 1/2 particle the spin angular

momentum has only two states it's not

true that an electron has only two

states it has an orbital motion and it

has a spin angular momentum let's just

concentrate on the spin and nothing else

then concentrating on the spin there's

only two possibilities up and down half

spin up has been down let's call them

like using red for equations let's call

them up plus and down lights

these are the two basis States with spin

angular momentum along the z axis but

there are certainly many more states

that I can write down these are not the

only states I can write in fact the

general quantum state of a system with

two states like this is to add them with

complex numbers alpha to beta or complex

numbers what is the probability in such

a state that the spin is our compass

with alpha star alpha okay

probability or up equals alpha star

alpha and the probability for down is

equal to beta star beta we add them

together total probability has to be 1

and so one of the rules is alpha star

alpha plus beta star beta equals one one

other fact that if I were to make a

phase rotation of each of these complex

numbers in other words if I was to

multiply alpha and beta by the same

phase e to the I theta e to the I theta

that does not change the physical

character of the state and the reason is

because all interesting quantities are

things times complex conjugates these

will cancel out of any interesting

physical quantity and so there's one

well the way to say it is there's one

degree of freedom namely the overall

phase of alpha and beta which is

unphysical in which doesn't matter which

is irrelevant

okay let's count now the number of

variables the number of

it takes to specify a quantum state of a

novice spin of an electron alpha is a

complex number it has two real

components beta is a complex number it

has two real components so so far we

have four real components but we have a

constraint alpha star alpha plus beta

star beta is 1 so that means only 3 real

components the number of independent

variables on the other hand one

combination the overall phase is

unphysical let's just ignore limiting in

some one way or another that brings us

down to only two independent variables

specifying a quantum state two

independent variables specify the

quantum state now how many independent

variables if an electron were a little

arrow of a given length its angular

momentum vector how many variables does

it take to specify the orientation of

that angular momentum to polar and as a

mutant angle of the sphere describing

the end of the vector they're the same

thing pause you rotate around the spin

of the electron by varying alpha and

beta but no matter which axis you

measure the angular momentum it's always

an integer that is to say the actual

measured value is an integer what about

the average value the average value B

now I'm sorry it's not an integer it's a

half integer plus a half remind us area

can you get anything but plus a half or

minus a half for the

average value the average price so what

is the average value mean was it average

value the average value means you take

repeated identical experiments where in

each experiment the electron was

prepared with exactly the same quantum

state and in each case you measure the Z

component of the angular momentum

sometimes you get plus 1/2

sometimes you get minus 1/2 the average

is to take the ensemble of all of them

together and up the Z component of

angular momentum and divide by the

number of experiments that you did just

the average and euro member that can

certainly be anything that does not have

to be for example if we just chose alpha

equals 1 and beta equals 1 what's the

average Z component of the angular

momentum zero zero in fact this happens

to correspond to the spin of the

electron along the x axis instead of

along the z axis up along this x axis we

rotated by 90 degrees

nevertheless when you multiple you

measure it along the z axis

you'll get plus or minus one but the

average is zero so it's the averages

which behave like the classical

variables if you take a spin up and you

rotate it by 90 degrees the average spin

along that vertical axis will be zero

the averages which behave classically

this is a spin along the x axis what's

the spin along the y axis everybody

remember no no no no okay good good good

guess but the wrong guess this is a spin

I visit the z axis is the z axis is the

x axis this corresponds to a spin which

is pointing along the x axis in this

direction for a plus sign with a minus

sign it corresponds to a spin pointing

still along the x axis but in the office

erection we still haven't found the one

which points along the y-axis i- i

correspond to orientation only y-axis

and with other values of alpha and beta

you can make spins which are pointing

along an arbitrary axis pointing along

an arbitrary axis means if you measure

the component along that axis you'll

always get the same answer so that's

pretty much spinning in a nutshell and

as i said it is the electric charge the

mass the spin of a particle are its most

important properties now there's a

correlation which i should not only

mention but emphasize very strongly

because it's one of the prime facts of

elementary particle physics it's

actually a theorem of relativistic

quantum mechanics but we're not going to

try to prove it then the field is a

correlation between the values of the

spin of the particle and whether it's

Primula nor a boson the fermions are the

ones that you can't put two of them in

the same state bosons

they have a probably exclusion principle

bosons are the ones that you can put

into the same state to behave like

photons and they make classical waves

have spin particles are always

fertilizers without exception by Heston

or now meaning one half we have five

have anything which is

measuring 1/2 units where the structure

is health units instead of our units

those are all fermions and all particles

which have integer spectrum like this of

all times

spin zero particle is always a boson

without exception a spin-2 particle is

always a pulsar now what happens if you

take two half spin particles techno have

spin particles which one of which

happens to have one value of m and the

other has another value of n each one

having 1/2 unit it could be three halves

of - 7 hams or whatever what happens if

you add up their angular momentum oh you

get an integer not a half integer that

tells you that objects which are made of

ours are an even number of fermions are

always bosons any object made of an even

number of fermions will have an integer

spin because it hasn't it - just think

it's emotional ah what happens if you

take a boson and add it to a friend on

oh let me give an example an example

would be a hydrogen atom eight protons a

half spin particle just like an electron

half not three halves are 5 has 1/2

proton has half spin just like the

electron you take a hydrogen and spur me

on you take an electron and you put it

in orbit and you create a hydrogen atom

the hydrogen atom becomes a hose out now

this is not the height this is not the

hydrogen isotope this is the hydrogen

atom with just a single proton is

goodliest guter on is a proton Valco

Neutron Neutron also is a half-strength

particle a deuteron is a boson

a spin and another

what about deuterium deuterium is a

proton and a neutron that forms a

nucleus with a electron in orbit around

it okay what's the what are they quantum

ability of the possible values of the Z

component to spin going to be you take

it's basically three half integers added

up three half integers will always be a

half integer again okay so a bond

together with a fermion is Fermi on a

boson it together with a BOS arms of

boson and a fermion together with her me

on as opposed so deuterium is Fermi on a

hydrogen with only one proton what I say

petunia think I got right incidentally

particles and antiparticles always have

the same spin same mass opposite charge

what about positronium australium is a

positron in orbit around that rough

electron and a positron orbiting each

other over that paper also both on set

of property being able to go through

things as I forget the O's arms have a

property to what be in the same state

either like super conductivity is that

two pairs of electrons together and they

act like that goes on there for but it's

a transparent or something like that

well okay before you can understand the

superconductor you have to understand

the superfluid a superfluid for example

helium from superfluid

let's talk about helium what though is

helium a boson and a fermion wonder

helium okay why is that it's not your

even numbers

that's got two protons two neutrons and

two electrons two protons and two

neutrons makes the helium nucleus an

alpha particle and two electrons

it's opposing so whatever bosons are

helium is a good example of it helium

atoms can all go into the same state and

it's when basically a super can su

perfluorinated is almost like a

classical wave that you make by piling

them up all in the same state

that's not quite right but it's called

another girl's they all move together in

the same state now an electron the metal

is a firm yarn

P Kemper to electrons into the same

state but how about pairs of electrons

here's a paradox okay here's a paradox

which we talked about last night but the

total diving in tonight you take two

fermions and you put together to make a

boson how can it be that you can put two

of those composites into the same state

when you couldn't put the constituents

into the same state does that make sense

does it it does a good what no okay I'll

tell you it does make sense

okay what or exactly means you know

that's to the next time I think I'm

running running enzyme and remind me

remind me about this this is so

interesting that it's worth

it's on how to fermions when they make a

boson how you can put the bosons into

the same state even though the firming

ons can't be part of the same state we

should get back to that I'm reaching

that point in the evening where oh I'll

get confused at the dryer yeah since

protons and neutrons are composite why

is it that their haps tin that this no

no the composite of odd numbers of

fermions probably brickworks

a quark is a half spin particle so it's

going to be a friendly on three fermions

make a premiere all right just the last

observation has to do with the Pauli

exclusion principle or comes along

discovered from staring at the periodic

table long enough how we said that you

can't put more than one electron into

the same orbital orbital in an atom no

he didn't say that he said you can't put

more than one electron into the same

quantum state he know very well that you

can put two and no more than two

electrons in the same orbital state in

the atom you know that because he knew

roughly speaking that the hydrogen atom

you double the charge of nucleus and you

put another electron in the two

electrons go into the same state the

same orbital spin so Pauli's exclusion

principle did not apply to the orbital

motion if it's it applies to the entire

quantum state the entire quantum state

includes the spin state you can put two

electrons into the same orbital in an

atom as long as the spins are in the

opposite direction

you can't put two electrons with spin in

the same direction as long as the axis

here you can't put them in the same

direction but you can't put them in two

spin States in the opposite direction as

long as they are different as long as

they are different two electrons and

two of them can't be the same corporate

state but quantum state includes

everything about the particle so that

means in every orbital in an atom you

can put no more than two electrons and

there are two electrons they have to be

what's called spin singlets which mean

this spin is canceled you can think of

that like mesh gears if they're going in

the same rotation they're going up a

structure going the same direction you

can serve the ears indeed I know I

connect my car or below I simply mean

the state of an electron if you ignore

the spin orbit or am I using orbital in

a way that chemists wouldn't use it

Louisiana's yeah yeah okay I'm what I

need by orbital motion is not what it

chemists use by appointment

what's an orbital again absolutely else

PDF I mean a quantum display a solution

of the Schrodinger equations a solution

of the Schrodinger equation ignoring

spirit it creates the chart the periodic

traffic up there and so that's how come

you have two electrons in here there are

two things you have SPD Analects darkest

blue orbital angular momentum but then

this principal quantum number which is

in and when I speak about the orbital

motion I mean both in

the orbital angular momentum it's a

chemist's notation to call orbital SPD

and all that stuff you know this stands

for I don't want a stands for America

yeah because we need it doesn't mean

circle but it actually means a quantum

state of zero angular momentum P means

angular momentum warm this is the

orbital motion of there D is angular

momentum to F this angular momentum

three and I know G comes after if I

don't remember that that's the that's

the orbital angular momentum of the

electron but the other quantum number is

the distant basically the distance of

the electron from the from the proton

and that's the principal quantum number

so what I would call the orbital motion

meaning this the actual motion of the

electron is a calm positive principal

quantum number and the orbital call that

let's call that a state of orbital

motion the state of orbiting both

principal and alright so the rule is

that Paola devised was that no electron

can have all of its quantum numbers the

same okay incidentally the orbital well

yeah yep I really care me not how many

are you can reduce the maximum yeah yeah

[Applause]

yeah we're not going to do that now

[Music]

see that I have intended to do it at all

see that the principle quantum number is

in the orbital quantum number than the

spin what let's take let's talk about

more battles in the sense that chemists

use it orbital means s1b and i okay yeah

the s and s particle is spin zero that

means the orbital angular momentum is

zero there's only one or one state of

the orbital angular momentum what about

P P is angular momentum or I'm talking

about orbital angular momentum one but

the rules of angular momentum of the

same for the leg Euler momentum spin in

your home so if you live in like the old

method is one that uses three

possibilities

if the orbital angular momentum is 2 and

it's a P wave or D by V state there are

our five states so when you say one that

actually needs up and down everything

everything being specified there are two

electrons or signals which all the

things which can be simultaneously

specified specified and then when

there's three and there's to each of

those young you get six more electrons

for a total of 80 right exactly I hadn't

intended to talk about atomic physics

very interesting and some features of

atomic physics show up again when you're

thinking about quarks orbiting each

other and so forth

different okay are any questions at a

brothel

I have a date tonight
