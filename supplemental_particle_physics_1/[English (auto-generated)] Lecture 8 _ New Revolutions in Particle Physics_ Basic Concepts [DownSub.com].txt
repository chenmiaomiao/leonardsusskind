Stanford University okay question the

question arose about the paradox of arm

if two particles both fermions make up a

boson can we have a boson two bosons

which are let's say in the same state in

the same state um perhaps a more general

question the wavefunction of bosons the

wavefunction of bosons is supposed to be

symmetric on the interchange of the two

bosons that means for example if you had

two bosons and the wavefunction

describing them was a function of let's

say x and y this doesn't mean the two

coordinates x and y in the x and y

direction x and y are simply now

standing for particle number one and

particle number two if they're bosons

then the rule is that that must equal

sigh of Y and X so another way of saying

you can't distinguish between the two

particles there's no difference between

saying you have a a two boson system in

the states i of x and y and saying you

have two bosons in the state Y so I have

Y and X it's interchange symmetric

between them okay in that case you can

certainly have two particles in the same

state for example a special case of this

would be that sy is a product function

sy of x and y is a product of I don't

want to use the label sy again because

I've used side to label two particle

wave functions but let's invent another

thing to describe one particle wave

functions let's just qualify and sy of x

and y could be 5x times 5y this would

correspond to a boson with two bosons

with wave function Phi with the same

wave function in other words

in the same quantum state that's what

this would mean a to particle state and

each particle is in the state by this of

course is obviously symmetric it is the

same as Phi of Y and X sorry 5y times

Phi of X wave functions are not

operators they commute wave functions

are just ordinary numbers they're not

matrices they're just functions of X and

they satisfy all of the algebraic

properties of perfectly ordinary

functions and so what did I write yeah I

mean I wrote the right thing so yes two

bosons can be in the same state and the

wave function be symmetric what about

two fermions the rule for two fermions

if we put them if we have two fermions

is that the wave function has to change

sign now that's a very odd thing but

nevertheless our that is the

mathematical rule the abstract

mathematical rule for fermions when you

interchange them the sign of the wave

function changes now okay so that's

that's the difference between them then

can you have two fermions in the same

state no because Phi of X and Y is not

equal to minus 5y and I you see what I

mean Phi of X times Phi of Y is not

equal to Phi of Y and Phi of X with a

minus sign all right now

supposing I have a wave function of foot

two particles can I make and it's not

symmetric and it's not anti-symmetric

can I make something out of it which is

symmetric or something which is

anti-symmetric so let me show you how

you do that supposing I had some wave

function which is neither symmetric nor

anti-symmetric let's just call it a Phi

of X and Y when you interchange X and y

it neither changes sign nor does it stay

the same so it's neither symmetric nor

anti

metric action alright if you want to

make something symmetric which is an

appropriate wave function for two bosons

you just add sigh of Y and X now this is

obviously symmetric if you went to

change X&Y this one becomes this one

this one becomes this one and nothing

happens to that now this is a symmetric

wave function this is a possible wave

function for bosons the any sigh of x

and y and if we're talking about

fermions we can do the same thing except

that we put a minus sign there now what

happens if we interchange x and y this

one goes to this one this one goes to

this one but the whole thing will change

sign and the whole thing will change

sign if we interchange x and y so this

is a wave function for fermions

symmetrized is called symmetrized and

anti symmetry seing a wave function for

two particles

okay now let's suppose we have four

particles all together for fermions okay

for fermions what are the rules

for for fermions and for simplicity

let's suppose there are two different

kinds of fermions let's say there is

electrons and protons and we're talking

about hydrogen atoms now the rule okay

so let's see what is the rule we have a

four body wave function

let's now let electrons be called X and

protons be called Y so the wave function

is a function of two X's let's call them

x1 and x2 y1 and y2 it's a function of

four variables what are the rules the

rules are first of all that the wave

function has to change sign if you link

to change x1 and x2 that's the fact that

the electrons are fermions it must also

change

brain when you interchange y1 and y2

incidentally uh let's say um let's let's

do this right it must also change sign

when you interchange y1 and y2 ah yeah

let's uh let's what that's the rule

those are the only rules sine change

when you interchange x1 and x2 that's

because electrons are fermions and a

sign change when you want to change y1

and y2 because protons are fermions okay

so let's see what kind of wave functions

we can build let's start with a a

hydrogen atom a hydrogen atom located at

the origin

I had a hydrogen atom located at a not

at the origin has a wave function which

is a function of its electron and its

proton so one nails picks out a

particular higher one one of the two

hydrogen atoms one now stands for one of

the two hydrogen atoms and this might be

some wave functioning wave function

governing one of the hydrogen atoms over

here but supposing I want to shift its

location how would I shift its location

well it's easy to shift its location you

just shift you just shift the origin of

both x and y I guess I don't really have

to do it ok I don't need to shift its

our origin and then we have another pair

and the other pair that is describing a

hydrogen atom at some other location all

right since it's a hydrogen atom at a

lot another location it has a different

wave function the wave function may be

the same except that it's been

translated but it is different Phi of x2

and y2

now in general this is neither symmetric

with respect to the X's or

anti-symmetric with respect to the X's

or for that matter with respect to the

Y's so it's not a good wavefunction for

fermions supposing I want to make it

anti-symmetric on the interchange of the

electrons that's very easy we just

subtract off here sigh of I just

interchange X 1 and X 2

leaving y 1 and y 2 alone all right so

that let's do that first

- sigh of x - y 1 Phi of X 1 y 2 it is

now our anti symmetric with respect to

the X's if I interchange the two x's the

whole thing changes sign but it's not

anti symmetric with respect to the Y's

okay how do I make it anti symmetric

with respect to the Y's the answer is

take the whole thing that I have here

interchange the two y's and put a minus

sign in all right so we put in minus Phi

of X 1 and Y 2 Phi of X 2 y 2 that's

exactly this was a sorry y 1 this in

this are the same except that y2 and y1

have been interchanged and I put a minus

sign in and then I want to entice Emma

tries this one with respect to the akin

to exchange of the Y's

so that becomes Plus that I have to

change the sign sy of X 2 y 2 Phi of X 1

y 1 ok so this is now anti-symmetric

with respect to both the X's and the Y's

if you interchange in this expression X

1 and X 2 it will go to this one and

change sign

if you will to change X 1 and X 2 here

this one and so forth the whole thing is

fully anti-symmetric yeah my problem is

if you if you take those two holidays at

home and put them closer and closer

there's nothing preventing you from

doing that because there are bosons

right there may be forces between them

there may be the the poly principle does

create a kind of force between the atoms

it it will make it very very thin there

it will make it essentially impossible

to put two atoms right on top of each

other but you'll simply attribute that

to a force but will you be able to put

two atoms into the same momentum state

momentum states are spread out all over

the place they are spread out in space

so when you put the two atoms into the

same momentum state you're not ramming

him in on top of each other and it

doesn't cost a lot of energy so yeah the

question of whether you can stick two

things on top of each other is a

different question than whether they're

fermions and bosons it can even happen

that your billiard balls can be bosons

you can't stick them on top of each

other there are high of hardcores

nevertheless they can be bosons you can

put them you can't put them at the same

point it just costs too much energy but

you can't put them into the same

momentum if so your wave functions I

give that eigen value eigen functions of

momentum then could you have the two

hydrogen atoms in this same eigenstate

of momentum and then you would have to

turn around in the same state wouldn't

you no no no no just take any any wave

function like this right is this its

anti-symmetric with exchanges 2x its

anti symmetric with respect to exchanges

of Y what about if I interchange 1 & 2 1

& 2 is interchanging the two atoms right

what happens then it's symmetric its

symmetric

yeah so it's symmetric with respect to

interchange of the two atoms and why

because when you interchange the X's you

get a minus sign when you interchange

the Y's you get a minus sign minus times

minus is plus so let's say ya if I

interchange 1 & 2 X 1 y 1 will become X

2 y 2 with the same sign X 2 y 2 will

become X 1 Y 1 again with the same sign

so this one will be these two will

transform into each other by

simultaneous changes of everything with

a 1 or everything with a - and that's

exchanging the two atoms likewise let's

say we have sy of X two Y one but here

we have sy of X 1 Y 2 both of them have

minus signs so these will go into each

other so the whole thing is symmetric

with respect to the interchange of atom

1 and atom - that doesn't mean that it

doesn't this is quite this whole story

here is independent of the question of

energies it may be impossible for other

reasons to put two things on top of each

other in space the reasons being that it

may be very strong repulsive forces but

a good example um yeah we just wrote

down a wave an appropriate wave function

for two atoms for two bosonic atoms no

this these may or may not be in momentum

space there may be anything it may be I

mean um what what is it are we saying

that if we have two bosonic atoms that

that's what their state will be yes okay

yes if we have a boson a if we have an

atom with a wave function sigh of x1 and

y1 and another atom if we didn't know

anything about this atom over here we

might write down a wave function for the

electron and proton the other

Adam and now we want to write down a

wave function which is appropriate for

the to atom system all right the wave

function for the two atom system has to

be anti symmetric when you interchange

any X's anti symmetric when you change

any Y and so I just basically use this

rule except I use it twice once to

exchange the X's that gives me the top

and then take the whole thing and

interchange the Y's and change the sign

the result is quite clearly if you look

at it carefully interchange symmetric

under the exchange of the two atoms one

and two atom one and atom to so that's

an and that at the end of the day at the

end of the day that is the rule that a

boson ik atom and another boson academ

when you interchange them the

wavefunction has to have the same sign

okay now what kind of states can you put

to ya momentum States you can put two

atoms in two are in the same wave

function that doesn't cost a great deal

of energy because they're hardly ever on

top of each other but it is true that if

you try to stick two atoms on top of

each other it's very hard to do because

it cuts very very costly in energy let's

see what would happen

in fact what would happen okay let's see

what would happen if we made both atoms

with the same wave function not one atom

with wave function Phi and one atom with

wave function sigh but two with the same

what happens then let's see um okay so

let's

okay so there are two atoms with the

same wave function we have to subtract

right so this is this sigh of x1 y2

sorry sorry is that zero or not I don't

think so it's not zero is it is it your

x1 y1 where else do you see

yeah yeah that's right they do no no no

it's not zero no this one and this one

are the same okay so it's just twice

this two doesn't the two is irrelevant

yeah we don't care about a factor of two

and twice this this is it and this is

not zero okay this is two atoms in the

same state it's not zero okay some magic

is going on here you can't put two

electrons in the same state meaning to

say the electron wave function has to be

anti-symmetric the proton wave function

has to be anti symmetric both are true

here but yet the two atoms are in the

same state so ponder that a little bit

write down that wave function and look

at it and of course the point is among

other things that in the atom the

electron is not in a in a well-defined

position it has a probability of being

many places in the atom you put two

atoms in the same place it's quite true

the two electrons can't be in the same

place that's true two electrons cannot

be in the same place let's see what

would happen our here's our wave

function for the two atoms perfectly

good anti-symmetric and so forth now

supposing we try to stick the two

electrons into the same place that would

mean setting x1 equal to x2

then it would be zero all right so

although the two atoms are in the same

player in the same state it's still true

that in that state if you try to find

the two electrons in the same place so

let's just see what would that be the

two electrons in the same place would be

sigh of x1 y1 sy of x1 y2 I've just set

the two x is equal to each other

- sy of x1 y1 sy of x1 y2 so I forced it

two electrons to be in the same place

and guess what I think they cancel yes

they do

ok so so as I said ponder a little bit

and you'll get familiar with it and

you'll see how it can possibly be the

two fermions can be a boson this is a

final mean that whereas you can exchange

too as to have them in different states

so this in this case before I fit it

before I said x1 equals x2 here these

two atoms were in the same state the

atoms are in the same state but the

electrons and the protons were never in

the same state

whereas educate when you when you did

this operation of antisymmetry Singh

you basically projected out the pieces

of the wavefunction where the electrons

were at the same point and when the

protons were at the same point

yeah so nothing was left of that piece

of the wavefunction it's still zero if

you go back to feet you're like wow - I

think feet for the second time use the

atoms are in different states but you

put the electrons in the same space yeah

yeah just any time you're trying to put

electrons in the same place or in the

same momentum that's going to be zero

right okay let's come back to spin a

little bit

spin is more fun than we've dealt with

so far the reason I'm spending time with

spin is because the mathematics of spin

is what you really have to know to know

such things as the mathematics of I so

spin in the mathematics of color and the

mathematics of all of the symmetries of

particle physics the mathematics is the

same the physics as was pointed out here

the analogies between these different

kinds of conserved quantities formal

mathematical analogies but nevertheless

let's study the mathematics have spin a

little more a little bit more about the

Dirac equation just a bit and then I

want to introduce the concept of

isotopic spin or ISO spin which is a

concept which I think dates back to the

30s okay um

so let's start with half spin the half

spin the electron is a half spin

particle so I'll call a particle an

electron I could call it a proton I

could call it a muon any one of the half

spin particles but let's just call it an

electron it has two possible States if

two possible values for the angular

momentum along the z axis along the z

axis we've called L sub Z we've called

that M are not quite not quite not quite

not quite there's an H bar in there

right but from now on we'll set the H

bar equal to you know what okay so if

for the electron this is not the full

angular momentum incidentally of the

electron if I'm using over a really

weird notation usually L is used for

orbital angular momentum and s is used

for spin so let's revert to that s for

spin s for spin but the mathematics of

it is exactly the same as the

mathematics of the l's

in fact we could write it down over here

let's write it down over here the

mathematics of angular momentum but now

I'm calling it s for spin instead of L I

don't know what L stands for it stands

for angular momentum alright so what was

the kind of commutation relations we

wrote down last time where LX with ly

equals IH bar LZ I now becomes SX with

sy is equal to IH bar but I'll set H bar

equal to one I s Z and cycle down in

order to the next sy as Z equals is X

and so forth all right cyclic

permutations all right oh one other

thing we have s plus and minus

just to remind you s plus and minus is

just s X plus minus i sy these operators

raise the value of the Z component or

lower it depending on whether it is a

plus sign or minus sign and so that the

raising and lowering operators for spin

angular momentum all I've done is change

notation from LTS intrinsic spin it

doesn't it could be any spin I mean it

could be a spin which is do the due to

you know the rotating basketball but but

let's say intrinsic spin entrance

explained yeah okay let's focus on half

spin half spin is the case where SZ or M

can take on the value minus 1/2 and plus

1/2 and that's all that's a two-state

system incidentally I'm also I'm also

forgetting completely everything else

about the electron we're forgetting for

example about where the electron is what

its momentum is and all that sort of

stuff just forget it for the moment and

they were just concentrating on the spin

all right so are concentrating on the

spin the quantum mechanics is the

quantum mechanics of a system with two

orthogonal states and only two

orthogonal states it doesn't matter

where it came from in quantum mechanics

the space of states is just the space of

test states of a two-component or a

two-state system and you can always

write it as a column vector let's call

it alpha and beta where alpha is the

amplitude that the spin along the z-axis

is up and beta is the amplitude that

it's down so you can always write the

state of the system the ket vector let's

call it the sy which is alpha

Plus pay the down along the z-axis you

can just symbolically represent it by

constructing a little column vector and

putting an alpha there and a beta there

alpha star alpha is the probability that

the electron is up beta star beta is the

probability that it's down and that's it

in the same notation operators become

matrices okay so operators become

matrices let's see what we can learn

about the matrices are these components

of the spin have to be 2 by 2 matrices

why 2 by 2 because the space of states

is 2 dimensional so they have to be 2 by

2 matrices and they have to satisfy this

algebra that's it if you can find 2 by 2

matrices which satisfy this algebra oh

one other thing we might want s Z to be

diagonal yeah no no not the dimensions

of space with them no no no no the

dimensions of spin space spin space spin

space yeah not the dimensions of space

not what I said to do is to forget about

space forget for the moment the position

of the electron to get its momentum

we're thinking now of an electron that

somebody has nailed down to the to the

wall so that it can't move around and

all you can do is measure its measure

its spin it has two distinct states if

you measure the Z component of its spin

that's it only two states and so let's

label them up and down any quantum state

of the spin is a linear superposition of

them with complex coefficients and the

probabilities are the probability for up

is alpha star alpha the probability for

down is beta star beta it's just a

change of notation a common change of

notation to replace this clumsy thing

here by just writing a little column

with an alpha and a beta and remembering

that the lower component stands for down

the upper component stands for up in the

same way operators become two by two

matrices and the two two by two matrices

just act on these two component vectors

yes no I said week week I will choose SZ

to be diagonal s Z it doesn't matter you

just you just search around and see if

you can find matrices two-by-two

matrices which satisfy this role

[Music]

yes it's an operator

it's the angular momentum it's our

observable it isn't observable it's an

operator and it becomes a matrix all

operators become matrices that act on

vectors to give other vectors okay same

thing we've done over in the past okay

all right so let's see if we can find

well I'm good of course we can otherwise

it wouldn't be doing this all right

three matrices which satisfy these

commutation relations X Y Z all right so

two by two matrices two by two matrices

all right they are not unique they're

not unique and the choice the choice of

them really corresponds to a choice of

orientation of axes right but there is a

choice of them which is particularly

useful for us they're all equivalent

incidentally as I say they're related

just by rotation of the spatial axes

spatial real space axes are and it is

not important what choice you use you'll

get the same answers but I will choose

the following choice

and you can check that these matrices

satisfy SX is equal to 0 1 1 0 sy is

equal to minus I I 0 0 s Z is equal to 1

0 0 minus 1 you will never find three

matrices which have these rule which no

sorry one half of this one half of that

one half of that ok check it just go

through it I will not do it on the

blackboard it takes two minutes to do

well maybe 3 3 minutes to do and you'll

find that these matrices do satisfy

these commutation relations here ok

they are the poly spin matrices the poly

matrices are these things without the

1/2 in front of them ok but the real

angular momentum matrices which satisfy

these rules here are half of them

without the half that call poly matrices

with the half they just call spin

matrices I think they're properly called

spin matrices with the half so this is a

representation I would say this is a

representation of the angular momentum

matrices a particular two component

representation of the angular momentum

of the of the half spin angular momentum

matrices ok let's now see if we can find

the states that means the states means

the column vectors which correspond the

Sigma Z being up and Sigma Z being down

alright or SZ being up and SC being down

those are the two possible orthogonal

States Augen states of SZ all right this

is very easy we just say what

what what does it mean to say a state

whose SZ is plus or minus it means an

eigenvector of SZ with eigenvalue plus

one or minus one we expect incidentally

that the components of spin have value

plus and minus 1/2 all right plus and

minus 1/2 but that means that the esses

should have value plus one and minus one

of course that's true these are these

diagonal elements here are the

eigenvalues of s so let's just be very

pedantic being very pedantic we're

looking for vectors let's call them

alpha beta which have the property minus

1 that this is either equal to plus or

minus let's say plus first alpha beta

this would be an eigenvalue in which

sigma z equals plus 1 what about Sigma Z

equals minus 1 that would be 1 0 0 minus

1 alpha beta equals minus alpha beta

that's the meaning of an eigenvalue in

an eigenvector if we find solutions of

these the solutions will correspond to

the states in which the spin is up and

the spin is down let's just check let's

check that out

ok so it's completely obvious well let's

just work it out the top entry here by

multiplex multiplication is 1 times

alpha plus 0 times beta so are just

multiplying out the matrices this is

going to be 1 times alpha plus 0 times

beta in the top and 0 times alpha and

minus beta in the bottom well obviously

this is not equal to this unless what

unless beta is 0 if beta is 0 then we've

found a solution to the eigenvalue of

the eigenvector problem which

corresponds to an eigenvalue plus

one and surprise surprise it corresponds

to a vector which only has an entry in

the upper place the upper place stood

for spin up what shall I choose alpha to

be I can choose it to be one why one

because I want the sums of the

probabilities to be one

so alpha star alpha plus beta star beta

should be one and a convenient choice is

just to choose alpha equal to one notify

let's let's put back what I erased what

I erased is that this thing times alpha

beta was alpha minus beta supposing I

want to get a minus sign then what do I

do choose alpha equal to 0 if alpha is

equal to zero this is true oops

and that corresponds to the vector 0 1

again no big surprise it corresponds to

the state in which the electron is

definitely down and has no probability

being up ok let's go a little bit

farther

what about we've done this many times in

these series of classes but though just

spend a minute or two doing it again

what about wave functions state vectors

whatever we want to call em ket vectors

corresponding to the possibility that

the X component of spin we're now going

to do a different experiment we're going

to measure instead of the Z component of

the other the spin we're going to

measure the X component of the spin

again the two possibilities are plus 1/2

and minus 1/2 what are the eigenvectors

which correspond to the two possible

measurements for that case all right

we're measuring Sigma X and not tho SX

another right in that case we want to

ask 0 1 1 0 alpha beta

equals alpha beta that's the eigenvector

with eigenvalue plus 1 and the

eigenvector with eigenvalue minus 1 will

have to satisfy 1 1 if such things exist

alpha beta equal minus alpha beta these

are the eigenvalue equations for plus

and minus here I've put in Sigma X

instead of Sigma Z Sigma X ok so what is

a topic wait let's let's do the top one

first what is the top equation say hmm

now think we'll paint it right look

let's start let's be pedantic again 0

times alpha 1 times beta so working out

the matrix product here of matrix times

vector it gives us beta alpha this

matrix just interchanges top and bottom

1 times alpha sorry 0 times alpha 1

times beta same thing on the bottom row

and so is there a solution of this

equation well yes all it says is beta

equals alpha in fact the bottom equation

says alpha equals beta which is the same

as beta equals alpha so we solved the

equation by setting alpha equal to beta

a convenient choice a convenient choice

they're all equivalent to each other but

a convenient choice is that we choose 1

over square root of 2 1 over square root

of 2 and y 1 over square root of 2 so

again so that the total probability adds

up to 1

[Music]

yes yes yes yes yes if we had included

the 1/2 we would be looking for

eigenvalue 1/2 so to look for

eigenvalues of SX we just look for the

twice the idea we twice the eigen value

for Sigma good point

okay all right let's see what the let's

see what the other possibility is the

other possibility is 0 1 1 0 alpha beta

which happens to be beta alpha that's by

multiplication here that should now

equal minus alpha beta that's the other

eigen value take this away for a minute

the thing in the middle here this just

becomes the eigenvalue equation or the

eigenvector equation for an eigenvector

with eigenvalue minus 1 alright and what

does that require that says beta equals

minus alpha and also said alpha equals

minus beta if beta equals minus alpha

then alpha equals minus beta and so all

we have to do is put into the entries

here sorry not this but alpha beta here

is equal to 1 over square root of 2

minus 1 over square root of 2 all right

so what does it say it says that if we

take a linear superposition of states

where the electron is up along the z

axis and down along the z axis we

superpose those states in the quantum

linear superposition we make an electron

which is let's use the word right word

which is polarized along the positive x

axis if we make the same kind of linear

combination with a minus sign then we

get 1 which is polarized along the minus

x axis all right so we've now accounted

for electrons which are up along the z

axis down along the z axis up along the

x axis down along the x axis and finally

there's the issue of the Y electrons

polarized along the y axis

I'm not going to work it out we can just

it's just - I sell you - I I alpha beta

you have to solve this one and this one

equals - and the two solutions are easy

very easy to do the two solutions are

alpha beta equals 1 I that's for the

plus sign I think that's for the plus

sign let's see I think that's for the

plus sign and the other one is 1 minus I

1 minus I yeah sorry excuse me

1 over square root of 2 again notice

that there's more information in these

complex coefficients than just the fact

that the probability of the Z components

of spin is 1/2 1/2 both this has

probability 1/2 1/2 so did the previous

case where the electron was along the x

axis the fact that there's an eye here

something new it tells us that the

electron is along the y axis right so

this way so now we've accounted for

electrons which are polarized along all

six directions what about a general

direction an electron which is whose

spin is pointing along a definite act

along a another axis well for that you

have I'm not going to go through it now

you take linear combinations of these we

won't do it now we'll do it another time

it's it's not something I intended to do

this evening all right so that's quantum

mechanics of a thing that the minus sign

goes on the other eigenvalue

I may have the sorry mom Dwight well I'm

thinking to the minus I over squared to

the first one because of the minus I and

maybe right I think you may be I think

you're probably right

so let's see so this one should be minus

then and this one should be plus I think

that maybe right and um so I have it in

my notes well I don't have it in my

notes

all right that's been a half that's the

whole theory of spin 1/2 all wave

functions are all state vectors

corresponding through all possible

directions of spin are linear

combinations of the two states in which

the spin is up along the z-axis or down

along with the axis so I take it back

yeah B equals ia ok that's a plus huh -

I never remember what about spin 1 we've

done this before I mean we've done this

a lot of times before and so I've made

fast work of it but now let's do spin 1

spin 1 is also interesting again there

are many many choices of the matrices

and they're all equivalent physically

equivalent representing the angular

momentum but I'm going to show you one I

spin one the Z component of angular

momentum has three states spin one is

the is the integer angular momentum it

corresponds to bosons and it's the case

where the angular momentum can be 0 z

component can be 0 1 or minus 1 so the

three possibilities evidently the space

of states is three dimensional now not

not two-dimensional three-dimensional

again we want to find spin matrices

which satisfy three matrices which

satisfy exactly the same

the algebra means the set of commutation

relations SX with sy equals I s Z and so

forth do there exist I've left out the H

bar because I've set H bar equal to 1

though there exist three by three

matrices which satisfy this the better

because we sort of work that we worked

out the existence of a 3d state system

by assuming these commutation relations

yes I will just show you a

representation and you can work it out

and see if if you can prove the

commutation relations they're three by

three matrices let's say I think it's s

sorry s Z naught Z but at C or s spin

along the Z Direction is equal to I

times 0 1 0 minus 1 0 0 0 0 0 it sort of

looks sort of familiar but not familiar

it's 3 by 3 but it kind of looks like sy

over there but it's it doesn't have the

factor of 2 it's different s let's see

what's next

sy is equal to I 0 0 1 0 0 0 minus 1 0 0

notice that this one has zeros in the

third row and the third column this one

has zeros in the second row and the

second column and SX has zeros in the

first row and the first column and it's

0 0 0 thats cs6 0 0 1

zero minus one zero there's a real

symmetry between them each one has a one

minus one they're all anti-symmetric

they're all anti-symmetric each one has

a one in the minus 1 and it has zeros

all along the row in diagonal that

matched the letter here if Z stands for

three then the third row and third

column are 0 if Y stands for 2 the

second row and second column are 0 and

so forth so they're easy to remember the

only trouble I ever have is remembering

the signs and again you check those by

checking the commutation relations okay

and they're not they're not completely

unique but let's see if we can find the

eigenstates of s Z this time as Z is not

diagonal I have not chosen s Z to be

diagonal but nevertheless so we can

certainly work out what the what the

eigenstates are not they're not too hard

to guess so we want to solve SC on well

we want to take this matrix and now

multiply it not by alpha and beta but by

alpha beta and gamma

how many what should the eigenvalues be

1 0 and minus 1 those are the three

states of Z component let's try for one

first I hope I haven't written down

yeah good news I do know um yeah yep

it's just incidentally this this corner

of it over here is very similar to the

sy over here so it's going to be similar

I think it's one minus I and zero so

here's an eigenvector I think this is a

true relationship you can check it later

ah here is an eigenvector with

eigenvalue plus one it corresponds to

the state where S sub Z where or where n

is equal to plus one I didn't give it to

you SC in the simplest possible form I

gave it to you in a very symmetric form

where x and y and z look very similar to

each other but nevertheless the right

way to find the state which corresponds

to M equals +1 is just to find the

eigenvector with eigenvalue plus 1 what

about the eigenvalue minus 1 that turns

out to be this one - and what about the

eigenvalue 0 Oh incidentally you should

put a 1 over square root of 2 if you

want them to add up to right okay what

about the eigenvalue 0 anybody see what

the what the eigenvector with eigenvalue

0 is 0 0 1

this one is obvious take the top row

multiply at this you get zero because

there's nothing to match this one

likewise here this is just plain zero

big fat zero okay what are these things

mean these mean that the three states M

equal to plus 1 m equal to minus 1 and m

equal to zero correspond to the vectors

1 minus I 0 1 I 0 0 0 1 these you might

want to put a square root of 2 if you

like to make that probability add up to

1 alright so again we really do find and

you'll find there were no other

eigenvectors no other eigenvalues that's

it and these are the mathematical

representations of the very abstract

things we did last time one of the

marvelous things is that these square

roots of 2 really do turn up in

experimental predictions and we're going

to do a couple of them but not with

ordinary spin but with isotopic spin I'm

going to show you how those square roots

are to turn up in various experimental

quantities but not not now

those opposed one over the spirit to

know Iowa the square root of 2 that's I

of the square 2 and the first is 1 and I

and minus I of is square root 2 1 over

square root of 2 minus I over the square

root of 2 and 0 1 over root 2 I over

root 2 and 0 this is I think Emmy goes 1

this is M equals minus 1 and this is M

equals 0 now as I said there are other

representations there are other Triplets

of matrices which satisfy the same

algebra but they are in fact physically

completely equivalent and I'm not going

to go into the reasons for that now

these are a good set of matrices to work

with they're fairly elegant and we'll

use them we use them more than once

ok um another question yeah

supposing we now return to the real

electron which can move around in space

it can move around in space so it has a

position or a momentum and the spin

incidentally spin and position are

things which can simultaneously be

measured spin in momentum Nothings which

can simultaneously be magma and be

measured what are the things which can't

simultaneously be measured well position

and momentum but also the different

components of the spin they are commute

with each other but spin and momentum to

commute with each other or how do we

represent the wave function or the state

vector of a electron given the fact that

it also has a position it has a position

and a spin and the answer is we turn

these two component the cold spinners

they're called spinners this is what a

spinner is the right hand side a

two-component object like this

which just represents up spin down spin

is called the spinner all right we just

turn the spinner components into

functions of position so let's uh let's

imagine that now the electron is free to

move around the full state of the

electron is described not just by a

simple function of X but by two

functions of X let's call it sy up and

side down of X and if we like we can

just make a symbolic notation where we

put them in a column what's the meaning

of this the meaning of this is the

following that you don't just ask what's

the probability that the electron is up

or the electron is down you ask a more

refined question the more refined

question is if the electron is found at

position X what is the probability that

it's up that may depend on X so the

probability that the electron is up

might depend on where you look another

way of saying it this classically just

corresponds to the classical statement

that the spin of the electron could vary

from place to place quantum mechanically

what varies is the probability to find

it up the probability to find it down

and so at every point in space each

point in space you have a spinner and

the spinner tells you at that point in

space what's the probability of the

electron is up well at size star sy up

sy up of X that's the probability that

if you look at point X and discover an

electron there and then measure the Z

component of the spin the Z component of

the spin this is the probability will be

up and psystar down of X side down of X

is the probability that

but at each point X you have all of this

apparatus here in exactly this form and

that's the whole story of what an

electron is an electron is a particle

described by a wave function which has

two components the two components being

the amplitude that the electron is up or

down what about a spin one particle

exactly the same a spin one are not

exactly the same almost exactly the same

but the spin one particle and I'm not

going to call it sigh let's just give it

another name phi phi is a more common

name for bosons and spin one particles

are always bosons so it becomes phi 1 of

x phi 2 of x phi 3 of x where each point

of space at each point of space this Phi

1 Phi 2 and Phi 3 replace alpha beta and

gamma from before so I 3 of X yeah okay

you understand so just reproducing

exactly the same structure over and over

in space and that's that's what's been

involved yeah

I'm not sure I would empower billing

that's one no no no okay so let's go

back let's go back good that's a good

question

all right let's find out let's ask what

is the probability here's our wave

function what is the probability that

the electron has a spin plus along the z

axis and spin - along the z axis and

spin zero okay let's work it out here's

what we have to do remember those

eigenvectors the eigenvectors of spin

for the spin one not for the spin zero

where are they okay for M equals one

that's spin up along the z axis the

eigenvector was one over square root of

two minus I over square root of two and

0 this is the eigenvector for M equals

one now I'll remind you what the rule is

for calculating the probability for this

condition given this wave function the

rule is take the inner product of this

with the complex conjugate of this we

take the inner product of this with the

bra vector corresponding to this ket

vector which is its complex conjugate

and then square it take it times its

complex conjugate so what we do is the

rule standard quantum mechanical rule we

take the inner product

we'll call the state here Phi and let's

call this M equals one we take that in a

product and then square it look like its

absolute value squared it times its

complex conjugate all right how about

this bra vector that I've called M

equals one bra vectors are always

complex conjugates of ket vector

okay so that means the bra vector can be

thought of as a row vector that's just

in a convention one over square root of

two plus I over the square root of two

at zero plus I because it's the complex

conjugate in the second place here I

over square root of two we take the

inner product of that with phi1 phi2

phi3 what is that I over the square root

of 2 Phi 1 the 1 over square root of 2

Phi 1 right

Phi 1 over square root of 2 plus I Phi 2

over square root of 2 and that's it 1

over square root of 2 Phi 1 Phi 2 over

square root of 2 times I and then we

multiply this by its complex conjugate

alright so what do we get what's the

complex conjugate the what what is this

times its complex conjugate give I think

it's just Phi 1 squared plus 5/2 squared

over 2 this times its complex conjugate

will give Phi 1 squared plus Phi 2

squared over 2 so the probability that

the electron is up along the z-axis

appears to be Phi 1 squared plus Phi 2

squared over 2 what about the

probability that it's down along the

z-axis I think it's the same

I don't think so is it dumb hmm no I

don't think so it can't be negative all

right I think it's the same for this but

they are for this state it's the same

what about what about the probability

that the Z component of spin is 0 that's

5 3 squared in that case the M equals 0

state is 1 1 0 and the inner product is

just 5 3 oh sorry 0 0 1 minus state is 0

0 1 and the inner product is just 5 3 so

the probability that the electron is in

the 0 angular momentum state is 5 3

squared ok so here are the probabilities

looks like it's 5 1 squared over 2 plus

5 2 5 1 squared plus 5/2 squared over 2

same thing

5 1 squared plus 5/2 squared over 2 & 5

3 squared

cama cama

those are the three probabilities they

add up to 1 by 1 square plus Phi 2

squared plus 5 3 squared ok sorry this

should really be no no Phi 1 squared

means Phi 1 times Phi 1 star no yes it

does it does it does I think I'll leave

this there for you to work out in detail

I don't um I hate doing things on the

blackboard when I don't have them in my

notes I tend to make mistakes and I

probably have made a mistake but you get

the principle the principle is take the

inner product of these things with oh I

know what I did yeah

the reason I got these two to be equal

is because I assumed that Phi 1 Phi 2

were real they don't have to be

real if they're not real you'll get

different answers for these two check it

out try it out and see what you get okay

but the principle is always the same

take the eigenvector take its inner

product or with the actual wave function

and take it square its complement iams

its complex conjugate that's a

probability and notice most important in

this case is that it's a function of

position these Phi's or functions of

position can vary from place to place so

that's the basic idea of spinning it's

an exercise to work it out for spin to

or throw off a spin three halves and

it's significantly more complicated but

not in principle not in principle and

it's not hard to find the the matrices

but a little harder all right I very

very quickly want to come back to the

Dirac equation let's say how we yeah

three hands should be four yeah let's

say three halves three halves is the

case plus 1/2 minus 1/2 three halves

minus three halves so the four states

spin-spin two is five states

this discussion seems to be symmetrical

with respect to time this XYZ penalty oh

that's true

yeah spin to something like math best to

find in the rest frame you most easily

defined in the rest train so in that

sense what you do is you study it in the

rest frame and then you find the right

way to Lorentz transform it to some

other frame but though we will do that

now it really doesn't change very much

when you go to relativity and that's

because the definition of spin is pretty

much what you would get if you did all

this in the rest frame of the particle

but yeah really we can we can simplify

the story just say it so far this is

pretty nonrelativistic it won't change

much in relativity with one exception

which we won't do now okay let me come

back to the Dirac equation and see what

the Dirac equation has to do with spin

again spin is best defined in the rest

frame but let's

[Music]

okay here's the Dirac equation it had

matrices 4x4 matrices and it looked like

this I decide by the T now the size were

four component objects so i1

side-to-side 3sy 4 where did that come

from

I'll tell you the moment where it came

from but let's write the equation the

equation is that this is equal to minus

I alpha sub M M runs from 1 to 3 the

three directions of space XY and Z times

the derivative of sy with respect to X M

sum over m so this is alpha 1 decide by

the X plus alpha 2 decide by dy plus

alpha 3 decide by DZ plus beta times the

mass of the particle times I that was a

Dirac equation that we wrote down a

couple of lectures ago

and let me remind you what the

conditions on the matrices alpha and

beta were in order what was the what was

the condition the condition was that the

frequency let me write this in a

different way this is frequency is equal

the momentum alpha dot K we can write it

this way or just alpha mkm this is the

same as alpha 1 k 1 or alpha x KX plus

alpha 2 k 2 plus alpha 3 k 3 which is

the same as alpha x KX of y KY alpha z

kz alright plus beta M this is shorthand

this is shorthand where do I have am I

missing an eye yeah

these are this eMeter and index this is

the pan mix of the particle okay well

let's not use em here I

hi good thank you mm-hmm yeah sorry

and this means sum over I usual

summation convention okay all right well

index is repeated twice it always means

you sum over it and we required that

Omega squared is equal to K squared plus

M Squared number what we did we took

Omega squared by squaring this out and

require that we got K squared plus M

Squared what were the conditions for

that the conditions were conditions on

the matrices alpha and beta I'll just

remind you what they were they required

every alpha R squared

to be 2 I believe is it - I think it's -

no no 1 1 every alpha squared I for each

I alpha x squared equals alpha y squared

equals alpha Z squared

no no beta is one matrix

Oh beta is a matrix beta is a matrix

it requires beta squared to be equal to

one these things are just there so that

you get the K squared plus M Squared ok

but then in order that you don't get

cross terms in order that you don't get

things like K times M when you square it

out or k1 times k2 and so forth we

require things like Alpha X alpha Y plus

alpha Y alpha x equals 0 that would be

for example the cross term between KX

and KY alright so same thing for Alpha X

alpha Z

we can we can write this in a needle

notation anti commutator of Alpha X

alpha y equals zero anti commutator of

Alpha X alpha Z equals zero and anti

commutator of alpha Z without for y

equals zero what about anti commutator

of Alpha X with alpha X oh sorry

and one more any alpha with beta should

be also equal to zero what's the anti

commutator of beta with itself - because

its beta times beta plus beta times beta

ok right so we can summarize these

commutation relations just by saying

that everybody is anti commutator with

himself is - everybody's anti commutator

with somebody else is zero ok simple Chi

anti commutator is a theorem it's not

hard to prove but I'm not going to prove

it that the smallest dimension the

smallest number of components the

smallest Maitri

matrices which can solve this are our

four by four if you didn't have the

betas here then you can find two by two

matrices which satisfy it in fact the

Sigma matrices the Paola matrices

satisfy it the Pauli matrices anti

commute with each other that's something

you can check and their square is equal

to one so if you didn't have the extra

beta matrix here the poly matrices would

solve these equations but in two-by-two

matrices there are only three matrices

which anti commute among themselves that

way and if you look for a fourth one

that just won't be one you have to go to

larger dimensional matrices you try 3x3

matrices there aren't you try 4x4

matrices and you find yes that there are

representations of this anti commutation

algebra here

I think I wrote down a representation

I'm going to write down another one

tonight which is a little different but

it's basically it is again its

equivalent so I'll give you an example

of four matrices which satisfy exactly

this algebra now 4x4 matrices is a 4x4

matrices but you can write them in block

form writing them in block form means

that you divide this up into two by two

blocks you have two by two blocks each

one of which is a two by two matrix

it's just a simple way to write them

down and then for the alphas for each

alpha alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3 put in

this two-by-two box over here the

corresponding cowley matrix Sigma I it's

a 2 by 2 matrix so it fills up 4 entries

here down here put the same power matrix

except with a minus sign and zeros here

that's pretty easy

I know I told you I used different than

a different representation last time

they are equivalent I think I put last

time I put the signals off-diagonal did

I yeah it's it they are equivalent

they're mathematically equivalent then

there are similarity relations

similarity transforms which relate them

but I like this one better I decided I

like this one better

and what about beta beta is just in the

same notation same two by two block

notation it's just one now what's one

one is the 2x2 matrix 1 0 0 1 it really

is one the unit matrix and the unit

matrix down here and that's it those but

those matrices have the desired property

entered incidentally when you multiply 4

by 4 matrices in this form you can do it

by tricks we're really you multiply in

the blocks 2 by 2 matrices so it's an

easy way to do this and it's no harder

than working with 2 by 2 matrices but

I'll leave that to your devices to check

these are the Dirac matrices the alphas

and the beta's or one particular

realization of the alphas and the beta's

big lesson is baby bodily lies - I'm

here well that was last time

hmm what's that this is different this

is a different representation the last

time I had these off diagonal and I

don't remember what I had for this one I

can't remember I thought I had beta

diagonal last time I thought I had beta

diagonal I can't remember yeah yeah yeah

okay this is a little bit different and

you get your choice the physics of it

will be exactly the same

they just correspond to choosing linear

combinations of the four entries in the

in the and there's no real difference

it's as physically interesting as

rotating coordinates what you're doing

is rotating coordinates in this four

dimensional space which is not

four-dimensional space-time these four

entries here do not have to do with the

with the four they're not direct the

same as the four dimensions of

space-time they're just the smallest

representation of this algebraic

structure okay um that's what the Dirac

equation is here it is you're a key

question it can be summarized in a form

like this where this really means of

this and um here are the matrices what I

want to do the only thing I want to

point out about it tonight is that there

are two kinds of two by tunas to this

one is these blocks and the other words

when within each block this by what

shall I call it this doubling of the two

by tunas corresponds to a doubling of

the two by tunas in physics the to one

of the two by two nooses is positive and

negative energy the other is spin all

right so there are particles of positive

energy with all possible spins there are

positive particles with negative energy

with all possible spins all right we can

see this

and that's why there are 4x4 matrices if

you like roughly speaking there's an

entry per positive energy with positive

spin positive energy with negative spin

negative energy with positive spin

negative energy with negative spin those

are the four possibilities that's why

when I say positive spin a negative spin

I mean spin along the z axis half spin

along the z axis that's why there are

four components to the Dirac equation

positive and negative energy exactly as

in the one-dimensional example that we

described and spin up spin and down spin

if you like that's why there are four

entries in the Dirac spinor Dirac

equation and perhaps the easiest way to

see what's going on is to look at a

Dirac particle with zero momentum just

take a particle with zero momentum that

means K is equal to zero in that case we

can just throw away the alphas

altogether and we get a very simple

equation when the momentum is zero that

means that sy is constant in space is

what it means it has no derivatives with

respect to space K is absolutely zero in

that case the whole Dirac equation just

becomes

[Music]

I decide by DT is equal to I M beta

decide by RSI that's it that's the Dirac

equation for a particle at rest particle

with momentum equals zero means a

particle at rest if it's at rest the

wave function has no space dependence

it's just completely constant with

respect to space and this is the whole

thing and it tells you what the possible

frequencies are we can write it a

different way we can write it or maybe

yeah

no I hear right no I there let's see

what it says um okay so here's the way

we'll think about it we'll take these

size sign one there are four entries one

two three four and we'll divide it the

same kind of division into blocks and in

each half of it the upper half and the

lower half I'll put a two then a thing

with two entries

we'll call us i plus + sign - the self

plus and minus mean positive and

negative and no if they don't they just

they don't mean anything right now just

plus and minus nothing special but each

side plus what a side Plus this is equal

size plus is psy upside down and the

bottom one here I think is something

else to others this corresponds to an

electron let's

okay we're just writing the column

vector in a notation which is similar to

the way I divided up matrices divided up

matrices by just drawing some red lines

and doing two-by-two matrices in here

we'll divide up the spinners the column

vectors by just dividing them in half

and in each place put a two component

object okay

so side plus + sign - are themselves two

component objects - two component

objects make a four component object

it's just a it's just a pretty way to to

organize the Dirac indices we go out the

Dirac structures here okay then we can

write this equation very nicely this

equation is pretty simple what does it

say beta is the matrix 0 1 1 0 what does

this matrix do when it hits a

two-component object so I plus sy - well

it does is it swaps the upper and lower

one when this matrix hits a vector like

this it just interchanges sy+ and sy -

all right we can also write this as a 2

component object sy + really a 4

component object but - 2 component

objects and now we can see what the

equation says what the equation says is

that I D by DT of sy + equals M sy - and

I D by DT of sigh - equals M sy +

that's the whole the whole upshot of the

Dirac equation for particles at rest

it's even simpler than that you can the

next step

anybody got a good idea what to do with

this to simplify it that's one thing you

could do

atom and subtract them atom and subtract

them okay so what happens if you add

them why D by DT of side plus plus sign

minus equals M sy + plus sy - alright

that's adding them and subtracting them

I D by DT of sy + - sigh - equals minus

M sy + - sigh - the upshot here is that

this really breaks up into uncoupled

equations for two things one thing is sy

+ + sy - does not get mixed up with sy +

- I - and so I plus minus sign - doesn't

get mixed up with sy + + sy - there they

satisfy equations which are completely

independent of each other how about the

frequencies of this one what can you say

about the frequency of this one I D by

DT is just Omega right if the wave

function has a definite frequency then I

D by DT just gives you its frequency so

this object here has a frequency this

one has a frequency Omega which is just

equal to M this one has a freak

see Omega equal to minus M because of

the minus sign here what does it say

about the energies of these two

solutions one of them is a positive

energy solution and one of them is a

negative energy solution so just exactly

the same as the one-dimensional example

we gave there are positive energy

electrons and negative energy electrons

I don't expect you to remember all of

this but the and to be able to deal with

all of this from one sitting with it

it's worth going back now finding a

little book on the Dirac equation and

going through it but basically the two

by two block enos here has to do with

positive and negative energy so I plus

plus sign minus our positive energy

things sigh plus minus sign minus our

negative energy things but that still

leaves the two by tonus of the

individual entries here each one of

these is a two by two entry so let's

forget sy + + sy - we've taken care of

that by adding them and subtracting them

but now let's look at the enter the

entry of just a one of them it also is a

two by two thing what is that two by two

thing it's the spin it's the spin which

is described by these poly matrices here

if we completely forgot about the two by

Tunas associated with the upper and

lower pieces here and just worried about

the two by tunas within here then that's

the same as the to by Tunis within the

two by two matrices here that's the spin

so the Dirac equation predicts that

electrons put that positive energy

electrons come in two different kinds

the two different kinds have to do with

the upper and lower components or the

up-and-down components within a side

plus here and that's the spin it also

predict

it's that there's a positive and energy

of positive and negative energy 'no stew

it that comes from here that has to do

with the existence of positrons okay

holes in the negative energy see of

positrons that's what the 4x4 is about

you can either think about it as

positive and negative energy spin up and

spin down or you can think about it as

electrons and positrons each of which I

have spent particles so yeah can you can

you portray the opposite way around the

big ones yep yep you're asking whether

you can

yeah absolutely you can yep you can put

the the positive and negative energy

this into the smaller matrices and the

spin into the bigger matrices yes you

can either way they're kind of

equivalent to each other and they just

correspond to reshuffling of the indices

did you on the positron explanation yeah

you can see from here that there are

both positive frequency and negative

frequency solutions the things which

have positive frequency are the sums of

these two and the things which have

negative frequency are the difference

between the two negative frequency means

negative energy positive frequency means

positive energy so if there are positive

energy solutions that means positive

energy electrons if there are negative

energy solutions that means negative

energy electrons what do you do with a

negative energy electron you fill it up

you fill up the Dirac sea with all

states of negative energy you always

lower the energy by putting in a

particle of negative energy if you want

to lower the energy down to the absolute

bottom you fill every negative energy

state among others you fill in negative

energy states which have no momentum I

just worked it out for zero momentum but

you fill all the negative energy states

and that's the vacuum you take a

negative energy electron and stick it

into a positive energy state you've made

an electron and a hole or an electron

and a positron so in exactly the same

way is for the one-dimensional example

the positive and negative energy

electrons become electrons and positrons

the other doubling becomes the spin so

they have spin particles which come in

particle/anti-particle pairs and that

was the prediction of the Dirac equation

you know one of these marvelous examples

of just fiddling with abstract

mathematics little bit a little little

and boy and then out comes this very

very dramatic and credible prediction

positive and negative energy particles

with spin and remember that spin had

only been discovered as in a sort of

empirical fact from that chart up there

a couple of years before I mean just a

few years before their act did this very

shortly short time before

and so yeah it was a very are you seeing

the negative energy electrons repository

no I'm saying the absence of a negative

energy electrons are positron

we went through this before you fill up

all the negative energy particles and

you call out the vacuum okay

you can't put more than one negative

energy particle in a state so the vacuum

takes all the negative energy a less

than zero

e greater than zero and fills them up

you put an electron into every one of

those states that has the lowest energy

because all the negative energies are

filled

that's the vacuum that's empty space now

you remove an electron from here and put

it over here not necessarily at the same

place up here what is that well now

there's a positive energy electron and

the absence of a negative energy

electron the absence of a negative

energy electron is a positive energy

positron okay it's exactly it's exactly

the same as in the one dimensional

example that we did where the absence of

a negative energy electron a hole in the

Dirac sea becomes a particle of opposite

charge and wide entire energy negative

electrons above that falls down into it

into here and today it won't fall down

to here right the weather default and

fill that again do that's called

positron electron dilation and it

creates photons well the first thing it

has to do is conserve energy

now how much energy does an electron and

a positron have both the positron and

the electron have positive energy why

does it like why does a positron a

positive energy because it's the absence

of a negative energy okay

it's the absence of a negative energy so

it has positive energy all it is is a

positive charge and a negative charge

when the positive charge and a negative

charge come together you can either

describe

as the annihilation of the positive

charge with a negative charge but energy

has to be conserved so photons have to

go off the other way to think about it

is as an atom you know where electron an

excited electron dropping down to a

lower state what happens then photons go

off right yeah just a question on the

mathematics so we hear you very clean

clearly cleanly shown how the Nizam

Anastacia this particular space today

you get a positive negative connotation

something so to get the spin

representations in a zero momentum state

yeah would you take the difference off a

little bit above okay I hard time see

how you get that cleanly because the

there's property off of these matrices

there there's three off matrices there's

more core American uh those three

operators has become the three cities

but in a zero momentum state you know so

look at the spin in the zero momentum

state out of the mathematic show that

simple

well the zero moment zero momentum

positive energy state let's say zero

energy positive that would correspond to

a spinner of the form let's call it side

plus sought with the same side plus here

okay

we want to set sign minus equal to zero

because we don't want any negative

energy part of the solution so that

means I plus that Plus alright well

alpha for example alpha is not quite

alpha is not really are you asking me

how you make the the spin operators from

the Dirac operators no how is this

weighs simply as you show

energy stations show how you discover

spin what you've discovered you've

discovered that the positive energy

particles come in up in a pair one which

you can call up and one which you

couldn't call down now you want to see

that that pair really has angular

momentum yeah that really has the same

now you can see that these poly matrices

do come into it okay but to see that it

really corresponds to angular momentum

you have two ways of going about it

one is through the connection between

angular momentum and rotation symmetry

and the other is through the fact that

angular momentum is conserved okay so

what you would want to show let's use

the conservation definition what you

would want to show is that in any kind

of collision where an electron comes in

and scatters off something else that if

you assign the electron an angular

momentum whose description is in terms

of this two foulness within here that

that angular momentum together with all

the other angular momenta and the

problem would be conserved all right

it's a little too much for us to do

tonight anymore what we can do more

easily is show the connection with

rotation symmetry but I don't want to do

this I'm I'm I think we've all reached

the certain limit by now there happens

to be another electron around it can

annihilate with the positron even if it

doesn't have the same energy yes yes and

then you just get a different number of

photons or photons coming out with what

I'll tell you what happens okay

supposing you have two electrons with

the same energy two electrons coming in

in the center-of-mass frame those same

farm assuming that you had the particle

pair and then another half electron

happens to be around oh it doesn't

matter which

trongs annihilate I mean the electrons

don't remember which one in yeah but

when you kick this electron out of here

you can kick it up to any energy it

doesn't necessarily have the same energy

as the positron yeah when you hit that

electron you don't necessarily kick it

up to the same energy you just hit it

you hit it and it goes somewhere some

other energy so the and then there's no

memory of which let's suppose there was

another electron around Dirac sea is

filled and now a positron not a puzzle

yes a positron is formed and another

electron then this electron can fall

into the hole or this electron can fall

into the hole in either case you get

photons out

I'm unclear so if you have let's say

about that pull the positron was the

eight level or whatever negative eight

right

why we're like negative 7 and negative

six drop into that and why would have to

be electron

oh no that can happen this is perfectly

good thing to happen but photons all

right so let's see we start let's see

what that says we start with negative

seven over here a hole that means a

positron one positron 1e plus a positive

charged electron notation for a positron

is E Plus notation for an electron is e

minus so we have one a plus within the

energy equal to let's say minus with an

energy equal to seven units right we

took the electron with minus seven units

and then removed it which means we have

plus seven units of positron and the

electron went someplace now let's not

even worry about where the electron went

the electron or the this became an

electron up here someplace now you ask

why can't one of these fall down to here

okay what would that mean you would

start with a positron and you would end

with a positron but you would end with a

positron of a different energy

this whole was a positron now an

electron from here comes and falls into

this hole is a negative energy electron

falls into this hole that's what you're

asking

okay so you started with a positron here

it was were they at the hole and you

ended with a positron it's just a

positron of a different energy so a

positron has changed its energy when a

positron changed its energy it can only

do so by emitting photons right how do

you make an electron change its energy

by emitting photons slamming it into

something and having it emit the

so a positron from here under the right

conditions can sorry a an electron from

here can fall down to here that's just

another way of saying the positron

scattered from one state to another and

radiated some photons

okay so wouldn't they've just always you

know because there's always higher

energy electrons when they all fall down

the only thing you bi reason the reason

it doesn't happen so you're saying why

is the positron stable why doesn't that

know the answer is because you have to

conserve both energy and momentum and

the conservation of energy and momentum

doesn't allow it to happen okay so we

can work that out but again all right so

why don't you ask me that at the

beginning of next week and I'll show you

why why the look you could ask you could

have asked exactly the same thing about

the original electron why can't an

electron always lower its energy and

radiate photons why can't an energy

electron just drop down an energy till

it's the lowest energy electron and the

answer is because it can't

simultaneously conserve energy and

momentum and emit photons just so it

just doesn't happen so so I will get in

touch with you and give you the exact

schedule we will definitely meet ten

times this quarter next quarter I have

less obligations so I won't be

disappearing on you next quarter
