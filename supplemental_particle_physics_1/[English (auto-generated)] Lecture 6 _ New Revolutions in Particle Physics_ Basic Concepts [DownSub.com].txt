Stanford University let's move on to the

Dirac equation or let's move back to the

Dirac equation I gave you the last time

the simplest example of the Dirac

equation and how its and the Dirac

equation is always an equation for

fermions bosons do not satisfy the Dirac

equation they satisfy something else

that will come to called the

klein-gordon equation or Maxwell's

equations this simple equation now

describes particles which move on a line

always to the right never to the left

and in fact when pushed will discover

all we had discovered that it describes

both particles and anti particles we can

think of them as electrons but only

moving to the right so let me go over it

again briefly before I do let's just

write a function on the blackboard

good-old e to the I KX minus Omega T if

K and Omega are positive well R let's

not say the positive let them be

anything for the moment if you remember

the velocity of a wave it's strictly

speaking the the phase velocity of a

wave the phase velocity of a wave is

just K over Omega if Omega is a linear

function of K then it's the same as the

group if the ratio of K to Omega is

universal for all K then phase and group

velocities are the same but in any case

this is the group velocity let's just

call it the group and when you write

this you may think I mean the absolute

value of K K can be positive can be

negative Omega can be positive or Omega

can be negative but I really mean it K

over Omega with its appropriate sign

if K is positive FK sorry if K is

negative and Omega is positive this

describes an object whose velocity is to

the left negative if both are positive

then it's a velocity moving to the right

okay again if K and Omega have the same

sign it's a wave moving to the right if

K and Omega have the opposite sign then

this ratio is negative it's fine no

problem with it it just means the wave

moves to the left did I write it wrong

I'm sorry it's uh you're right it's

Omega over K it wouldn't matter for the

sign of it the sign is the same whether

it's K over Omega or Omega over K ya

okay now let's write down a very very

simple equation for the motion of a

particle on a line the line is X again

we have time and it is D sigh by DX plus

d sy by DT equals zero this describes

waves and in fact it describes waves of

this form here can you tell whether they

going to the left or the right

you think they going to the right huh

okay I think you're right you all right

okay so let's let's check the side by

the X we'll just pull down a factor of K

if this were the form of if this were

the form of sy we can use this equation

to tell us what the relation between K

and Omega is decide by the X taking the

derivative with respect to X pulls down

an IKE a taking a derivative with

respect to t pulls down a minus I Omega

all of that just multiplies whether the

original function here and if we set it

equal to zero

it just says that I K is equal to I

Omega or the K is equal to Omega and

that's obviously a wave that moves to

the right as was said okay ah in most of

the right but now in general there are

two possibilities for a given well ah

yeah there are two possibilities we can

plot this relationship here Omega versus

K and it's just a straight line I've

actually left out the speed of light

where would the speed of light go in

this equation let go here or does it go

here yeah all right one of us see here

right another yeah Ct is like X I'll be

one of us see here so be a see here yeah

we'll set C equal to one for convenience

then Omega is proportional to K and you

can see and of course Omega if h-bar is

also equal to 0.1 oh if H bar is equal

to 1 then Omega is also the energy of an

individual quantum alright so over here

and this branch positive K we have

positive energy over here on this branch

we have negative energy negative energy

electrons not a good thing because any

electron which has positive energy can

proceed down this line here bum bum bum

bum fall down the stairs by continuously

emitting photons of positive energy and

no electron would be stable in fact the

world would not be stable it we just

want to fill up with more and more and

more negative energy electrons but

certainly no electron would be stable

all right so what do we do we fill up

the Dirac see the Dirac see use the fact

that you can't put two electrons in two

the same state we can stabilize

everything against this bump from

falling down the stairs process by just

saying all negative energy electrons

states are filled the filled to begin

with that is the lowest energy state if

you want to lower the energy state the

energy of a system maximally put as many

negative energy objects into it as you

can find all right just keep piling in

negative energy objects and that will

lower the energy so filling this up here

completely gives you the Dirac sea and

it gives you the ground state which

we'll call the vacuum yeah cuz just go

through yeah but if it was yeah if the

momentum would discrete it would be like

a staircase if it's continuous you just

slide them continuously emitting photons

as you go but once you fill up the Dirac

see the negative energy C then a

positive energy electron has no place to

go well it could fall down a ways but

they can't go indefinitely to fall down

perhaps in the mid some photons but it

can't go very far okay so that's

incidentally you can see why it's

important that if an equation is like

this that had better be an equation for

fermions okay now we remove a particle

from the negative energy C let's draw

let's put over here a hero all the

energy levels Omega equals zero zero

energy positive Omega and negative Omega

we fill all of these up so these are all

filled up can't put any more in there

these are empty

that's the vacuum now we want to put an

electron in well we can put in a

positive energy electron in that's fine

we can't put a negative energy electron

in but what we can do is move

electron from the negative energy city

and move it into the positive energies

here it doesn't have to be symmetrically

located we can take a electron from here

and put it anywhere over here and that

creates two objects one of them is a

hole in the Dirac see a hole in the

Dirac sea has now the Dirac sea is

always associated with these particles

of negative K and negative Omega what

happens if I remove a particle of

negative K in other words negative

momentum to create a hole what does a

hole have but we'll forget to charge a

positive charge also but in terms of

momentum we've removed a particle of

negative momentum so we have created an

object with an extra excess relative to

the vacuum relative to the vacuum it has

one positive unit of momentum so

relative to the vacuum when we remove a

particle from here and put it here we

create something of positive energy and

positive momentum in fact when we take a

particle from here and here we create

two things we create a hole with

positive momentum and positive energy

and an electron with positive momentum

and positive energy

so both the holes and the particles move

to the right they both move to the right

they both have positive momentum and

positive energy and that's okay that's

the fact of this equation here positive

charges for the anti particles negative

charges this is just a definition of

course negative charges for the

particles positive charges for the anti

particles everybody has positive

momentum and everybody has positive

energy for all the real objects in the

theory okay that the that's the simple

Dirac equation psy is built up

out of creation and annihilation

operators in the standard way what I was

kind of confused by this diagram because

we're talking about something that one

designer that third line that you kept

pointing to has k NW k Omega both equal

to zero and no GPF three axes three axes

sorry this is just the four that's just

a 45-degree line that's Omega equals K

yeah Omega equals K right right no I

think you probably weren't confused you

were just confused by the fact that I

drew three axes except that I didn't

write those two axes and a curve okay

now this is a little bit weird huh I

mean particles which can only go to the

right perfectly consistent but it has

another weirdness also the vacuum has an

odd property that it's full of momenta

which are negative momentum the whole

thing must have an enormous momentum

shooting off to the left all right who

cares if that's what's called the vacuum

let's just define it to have zero

momentum but still it is a little bit

odd particles can only go to the right

anti particles can only go to the right

nobody goes to the left but nevertheless

the vacuum is filled with these negative

momentum things it's not very symmetric

between left and right for one thing if

we may ask can you what can you do to

straighten it out in other words to make

it more symmetric with left and right

and the answer is you have to introduce

two kinds of electrons right movers and

left movers all right these are right

movers

so let's indicate it by putting our here

right off all right and let's invent

another field describing the left moving

particles

left-moving particles will describe an

equation will be described by an

equation which is similar except that

will want Oh make it to be minus K all

we have to do is change the sign of one

of these two terms doesn't matter which

one so if we rewrite an equation let's

let let me let me write this here as

Desai right the sign right by DT is

equal to minus Desai right by the X

that's a right moving wave a left moving

wave of another field completely

separate field different creation

operators different annihilation

operators describes a different kind of

particle namely a left mover is equal to

plus Desai right by the X if we work out

the relation between Omega and K in this

case its Omega over K equals minus 1 in

this case it was Omega over K equals

plus 1 hmm Oh left left these are right

movers these are left movers okay the

only difference is the sign of this term

here now we have a bunch of left moving

particles with positive energy in other

words there's another branch here these

are right molars these are left movers

right movers and left movers there's

another branch with positive energy but

also another branch with negative energy

what do we do to stabilize the left

moving electrons so that they don't fall

down the stairs

we fill the see of left moving electrons

the negative energy see of left moving

electrons now we have as many left

moving as right moving

cause in the sea and so it's balanced

it's a symmetric with respect to left

and right vacuum or empty space what we

think of as empty space no longer has a

huge momentum in one direction that's

been canceled out and we can now have

left moving or right moving particles or

left moving and right moving holes

yeah this is the normalization absolute

values have to a very wide play like a

whole operation which e0

yes no is there some other way of

achieving the exclusion without having

postulating filled state sure yes you

just so called filled States you co fill

negative energy states empty states of

holes you say a filled negative energy

state is an empty anti particle state

you just relabeled

rename and now we say this is a theory

of particles and antiparticles both of

which can move both left and right and

we never talk about negative energies

again right but but I find it well when

I first learned this I no longer think

this way I don't think this way anymore

but when I first learned it I found that

rather comforting to realize that yes

this whole thing did make sense and you

could prove to yourself that it makes

sense just by saying well this is kind

of like a metal where you fill up all

the states and then you make holes and

particles and if a metal is consistent

well this is as consistent as that so

what's the mass of these particles

the massless why are they massless

because they move with a speed of light

okay we'll come back in a moment and try

to make them massive I will try to make

a mess of at a moment but just as a

matter of notation let me teach you a

notation which is important in this

subject

let's take sigh right and sigh left and

put them together and make a column

vector out of them now this is purely

notation there's no physics in it but

it's not a notational trick which we'll

use over and over again let's make a

column vector out of them or a column

out of them right and then rewrite this

equation in the following way I well

okay that means time derivative well

let's go first of all let's call a side

it's now just sigh but it's a column

vector it's not the left no right that

contains both of them now let's take

these two equations and combine them

together into a single equation for sigh

all right for the column vector sigh

I'll write down what it is and then

we'll just look at it and see what it

says what it says is that D by DT of sy

is equal to something that I'm going to

call alpha times decide by the X

let's put a minus sign in there by

definition there's a matter of

definition what is alpha

all right good work okay the side by DT

is alpha decide by DX what does alpha

alpha is a matrix alpha is a matrix

whose value is 1/4 right and minus 1/4

left okay so what matrix is it alpha is

the matrix 1 minus 1 0 0 in other words

to write it to write it in column vector

notation and matrix notation

it just says this is equal to alpha

which is 1 minus 1 0 0 DS I write by DX

this I left by the X oops is a minus

sign there should be a minus sign in

here like that all right so this is just

a fancy trick for writing 2 separate

linear equations like that and putting

them together into a matrix notation and

it's very convenient but it hasn't done

any new physics now so far the two

particles are both the left move is and

the right move is a massless they move

along the z-axis with with the speed of

light can we make them massive can we

add to these particles or to these

equations something which makes the

particles have mass so that's a

important thing after all electrons do

have mass they do move with the speed of

light so for that we have to remember

what the connection between energy and

momentum is for a massive particle from

massless particle energy is just

proportional to momentum Omega equals

plus

- Kay how about for a massive particle

so let me write over here let's yeah

what's the relationship for a particle

of finite positive you know planet mass

Omega versus K Omega squared equals

anybody remember not no no no that's

that's done relativistic we want

relativistic now now we're really doing

it's obvious we must be doing

relativistic physics because we're doing

something which is approaching the speed

of light right non relativistic is a

special case of relativistic when things

move very slowly all right but what's

the formula for a relativistic particle

of mass M square root of K squared plus

M Squared right Omega equals square root

of K squared plus M squared we need an

equation if we want to describe massive

electrons where the relation between

frequency and wave number is going to be

this when M is equal to zero it just

says Omega is K Omega is minus K Omega

is K or Omega is minus K if we have no

mass that's the case we've done now we

want to do the case with a mass okay how

do we do that

not not obvious it's not obvious but

let's let's play with it a little bit

let's rewrite this equation first in a

in a neat form which will be convenient

for us when you take a wave and you hit

it with D by DT what it does is it just

gives you a minus I Omega and then we

can put sy over here if we like because

let's just remember this just means D by

DT on sy gives you a factor of minus on

I Omega that according to this equation

is minus alpha now what does this give D

by DX gives minus I K while canceling

out the eyes and the minus signs it says

this odd equation that Omega is equal to

alpha K now this is just shorthand for

this relationship here no there is not

and the reason is because D by DT gives

you minus I or plus I Omega D by DX

gives you minus I K so that cancels a

minus sign all right this is just a

shorthand trick for rewriting this it

says when you apply these objects to a

plane wave you'll get you'll get the

relationship that Omega is either K or

minus K that's what this alpha is it's

just an instruction for the upper

components here it's one for the lower

components that's minus one alright so

that sets a brief shorthand for for

these two equations that Omega is equal

to K four right movers Omega is equal to

minus K for leftovers yeah

this is all we need if we ask how fast a

particle goes with this relationship

here what we want to do is compute the

Omega decay that's the that's the group

velocity okay

and that's something like K over square

root of K squared plus M squared and

that tells us the velocity of a particle

or a wave is proportional to its

momentum divided by square root of K

squared plus M Squared

so that's built into here how fast the

waves move okay let's try let's just be

a little clever and try to correct this

equation Omega is equal to alpha K and

let's put yeah no Omega Omega is really

a two by two matrix really strictly

speaking it's really a two by two matrix

and so and and K is a 2 by 2 matrix

proportional to the but but as I said

what it really stands for is this it's a

trick for rewriting this in an efficient

form I don't want to have to rewrite

these derivatives every time I work with

them just think of Omega as I D by DT

and K is minus ID by DX and imagine the

whole thing is operating on a wave

function ok so this is a this is

shorthand okay let's add something to

this now

something with a mass in it I'll write

it down

mass times something times what I don't

know maybe not e beta okay let's call

beta

don't even know what beta is at this

point we don't even know what beta is at

this point presumably it's also a matrix

Omega equals alpha k plus beta M plus M

beta and let's require of whatever alpha

and beta are let's require that Omega or

Omega squared is equal to K squared plus

M squared let's place that as a

requirement on the matrices alpha and

beta or I just gave away what beta is

it's a matrix

okay so let's square this Omega squared

is equal all right so let's let's let's

ma let's alpha K plus beta n times alpha

k plus beta m what do we get we get

alpha squared K squared that's good we

want a K squared there we want plus beta

squared M Squared that's good we want an

M squared there but now we get some

garbage we get alpha times beta k times

m alpha beta K times M and then beta

alpha K times M K and M which is numbers

of course they're just they're just a

momentum and the mass of a particle so

what do we get we get alpha beta plus

beta alpha times K M this is good we

want that and it tells us immediately

whatever alpha is whatever whatever

alpha is whatever kind of mathematical

object it is alpha squared needs to be

warned we also want M squared there so

beta squared whatever beta squared is it

needs to be warned but we don't want

this term this term has no place in this

formula and so what do we want we want

whatever alpha and beta are that they

have the algebraic property that alpha

beta plus beta alpha is equal to zero

this would be impossible with alpha and

beta is just being numbers you can

certainly satisfy this alpha squared is

equal to 1 that's no problem

beta squared equal one that you can also

solve but how are you going to solve

this together with this if they were

just numbers it would require either

alpha or beta to be zero but this is

that neither alpha nor beta are equal to

zero on the other hand if their matrices

it's quite possible so let's begin with

Alpha squared equals 1 we've already

specified what alpha is the square of

this matrix is indeed 1 the square of

this matrix is just 1 1 what other beta

is it it also had better be a matrix R

whose square is 1 but it can't be the

same as alpha if it was the same as

alpha then alpha beta plus beta alpha

would just be twice alpha squared and

that would just be 2 so it can't be beta

can't be alpha it also has to have a

square which is equal to 1 but there are

more matrices around here's an example

beta is equal I'm not beta squared but

beta beta is equal to 0 1 1 0 let's

check that let's square it if we square

it

what's beta squared is equal to this 0 1

1 0 ok in the upper left hand corner we

have 0 times 0 plus 1 times 1 good

that's good and then the lower its

trivial you can work that out yourself

the square of this matrix is indeed 1

that's good but more not more important

but equally important is that alpha beta

times beta alpha is equal to 0 in other

words that alpha beta is minus beta

alpha let's check it let's just do these

things once and on a blackboard and then

then after that you believe me

ok alpha beta is 1 0 0 minus 1 that's

alpha beta is 0 1 1 0

this is alpha times beta alpha beta when

I multiply these matrices Rho times

column I get zero this one times this

one is 1 this one down here times this

is -1 this times this is 0 so that's

alpha times beta how about beta times

alpha let's do it in the opposite order

0 1 1 0 that's beta alpha is 1 0 0 minus

1 the corner element the left corner

element the left diagonal element is 0

times 1 plus 1 times 0 good that's 0 but

let's look at the upper right-hand

corner that's 0 times 0 1 times minus 1

so whatever it is we get a minus 1 here

at 0 0 and a 1 yeah or one down here so

alpha beta is the negative of beta alpha

this is the negative of this alright so

indeed it's true this matrix here is

square is 1 and it anti commutes with

alpha alpha beta plus beta alpha is

equal to 0 that's another way of saying

that as matrices these things anti

commute there are other possible choices

I'll come to another one in a while okay

so we've actually found the solution of

this if we choose for alpha and beta the

two matrices that are written here and

then rewrite the Dirac equation let's

write it out specifically R in terms of

its components right it has real

equations by real I don't mean real as

opposed to imaginary I mean just

explicitly very very explicitly writing

down the equations to see what they mean

once we know alpha and beta we can now

plug them in okay so let's here we are

for say that in column notation it says

that sigh right sigh left

let's see here it is Omega equals alpha

K so Omega is always the same as I times

the time derivative so I times the time

derivative is equal to minus I I believe

times the X derivative of sigh I have

this right and the X derivative of sine

left now I'm missing a minus sign here

right where did that minus sign come

from it's alpha remember what alpha is

it's the matrix 1 minus 1 0 0 so this

minus 1 here gives you a negative sign

down here but now let's write the other

term plus beta times

sy itself beta times sigh right sigh

left what is beta theta is the matrix 0

1 1 0 what does this matrix do when it

acts on sy right and so I left it flips

them so let's just do it

sy left side right and now we see what

the thick various equations are I sigh

right dot is equal to minus I DX sy

right plus is a mass here M plus M sigh

left

it throws I left into the equation for

sy right and likewise i sy left dot is

equal to plus I the x sy left plus M sy

right

that's explicitly what the equations say

can write them in any number of form I

can also write it as I side dot is equal

to I minus I alpha decide by the x + n

beta s I in this form I must remember

that these are columns and that these

are matrices in this form it's just

absolutely explicit are what the

equations are and beta interchanges or

beta interchanges side left and side

right so these equations become coupled

equations the left and the right move

has become coupled that's what a mass

term does very strange and nobody would

have expected this before Dirac that

that somehow what a mass for an electron

is is it's a term in the equation force

I write which is proportional to say

left and a term force I left which is

proportional to say right yeah oh this

these equations are automatically

conserved momentum because they're

translation invariant right but the

particle now has a mass this equation

the electron now has its mass its mass

is just M so that's a remarkably

beautiful and simple equation it is a

beautiful and simple equation but let's

not but it is a beautiful and simple

equation

is it Lorenzen very no solutions should

not be Lorentz invariant solutions

should be learned covariant the meaning

of that is a given solution for example

might describe an electron moving with a

certain momentum if you Lorentz

transform it it will be moving with a

different momentum so it should not be

invariant what our Lorentz

transformation should do is it should

carry a wave function describing a

particle of a given momentum into the

Lorentz transform momentum and yes in

that sense this is this is Lorentz

invariant we're not going to prove it

but it's satisfied the one key test that

Omega squared is equal to K squared plus

M Squared and that is a Lorentz

invariant relation Omega squared equals

K squared plus M Squared and yes these

are these equations are Lorentz

invariant ok let's let's go to the limit

just to look at a little more clearly

let's go to the limit now which we could

not do in this case without the mass

term let's go to the limit where the

electron is standing still you can't

make a massless particle standstill

it always moves with the speed of light

but once the particle has a mass you can

a lot you can study it when it's at rest

at rest means its momentum is equal to

zero to let the momentum be equal to

zero we can just anywhere is our

equation our equation was Omega was

equal to alpha I was at minus no alpha K

plus beta M let's just manipulate it at

this level first and then we'll write

down what the equation is what the

equation of motion is the set k equal to

set the electron to be at rest that's

the same as setting its momentum to be

equal to zero ok momentum equal to zero

first of all says that the wave function

has no space variation of

all if K is equal to zero there's no

space variation it's just constant with

respect to space if the wave function is

constant with respect to space normal

meant them and we can throw this term

away in any case when acting on wave

functions which have zero momentum or

zero wave number then Omega is just

equal to beta times M so for particle at

rest its energy is just equal to beta

times M or we can what does that mean

what does it mean arm let's write it in

this form I decide by DT that's how you

get omega by hitting it with I D by DT

that's equal to beta M sigh so for

particle at rest where we can throw away

the space variation the Schrodinger or

the Dirac equation just becomes I decide

by DT is equal to beta m times I or to

write it another way

sigh right dot with an eye is equal to M

sigh left and I sigh left dot is equal

to M sigh right did I get that no no

minus sign one of them has a minus sign

yeah beta this one has a minus sign no

no minus sign no my minus sign minus

sign

no - sine beta has no minus signs in it

beta is 1 1 off the diagonal so this is

the simplified Dirac equation for

particles at rest or near being at rest

ok notice that they're still coupled

together in this left right way but to

decouple them to find or

canary equations which are not coupled

in this way all you have to do is add

and subtract these two equations let's

add them what do we get then we get I

sigh let's call it plus so I plus means

so I write plus sigh left when we add

them I sigh right plus I left is equal

to M times sigh left plus I right which

is just side plus we now have a equation

for an object which is decoupled just

one equation not coupled to anything

else and what about the other

possibility let's subtract them when we

subtract them we get I sigh - dot sigh -

asyraf sigh right - I left and what do

we get on the right hand side is it M

sigh - - and sigh -

so by adding them and subtracting them

in other words taking linear different

linear combinations we find two objects

one which satisfies an equation where

the plus sign and one was satisfies an

equation with a minus sign which if we

just look if we just imagine that sy has

a frequency then this is also the same

as Omega equals n for the plus sign and

Omega equals minus m for the minus sign

Omega equals plus M for this equation

and Omega is equal to minus m for this

equation so notice what's happening when

the particle is at rest it also has

positive and negative frequencies when

it was moving with the speed of light sy

left inside right had positive and

negative frequencies or but when the

particle is at rest

it's the linear combination sy + + sy -

which have definite frequencies plus and

minus so sy plus is the field operator

describing positive energy particles at

rest and sy - is the field operator

describing negative energy particles at

rest what do we do with negative energy

particles at rest the bad things we

don't want them what do we do with them

we just fill the Dirac sea with them we

fill them up so what we have left over

then is the + electrons here the

electrons which are linear combinations

linear superpositions of electrons left

moving and right moving electrons the

linear superposition of electrons left

and right makes an electron at rest R

with a frequency or an energy

proportional to mass the difference

gives you an electron with negative

energy you just fill up the Dirac sea

with it

okay so now you have particles with mass

both positive and negative energies in

fact for every momentum there are

positive and negative energies you'll

fill up all the negative energies and

you leave the positive energies alone

there are positive energy electrons and

positive energy holes they're both holes

and particles now have mass the negative

energy electrons when you remove one has

positive energy and so a hole has

positive mass just as an electron has

positive mass or just as the original

particles had positive mass so you see

that it's it's some it's a very odd

thing as I said nobody had any idea at

all that that the way to make massive

particles in quantum mechanics was to

take left movers and right movers and

have the left movers coupled to the

right movers in this odd way it's now

commonplace idea that coupling left

movers to right movers gives you massive

particles but it's still it's a rather

surprising and interesting fact yeah

right here - all right just in case you

don't know what's I plus R minus R sy

plus is equal to side right plus sign my

left and sign - is equal to side right -

I left what does it mean to add wave

functions or add field operators this

way you can ask what happens if sy right

+ sy left

acts on the vacuum what does it give

does it give you two particles one left

and one right sorry plus RI there no L

mean so I left x sy right would be two

particles so I left contains creation

operators i right contains creation

operators you multiply them together it

gives you products which create two

particles

what about sign left side

was it

how many particles give you first of all

one is it left-moving arrival dream

accommodation 3 which means which means

that it's a particle with half a unit of

probability of being a left mover and

half a unit of probability of being a

right mover

it's a coherent linear quantum

superposition so these plus and minus

operators are field operators which

create particles which are linear

coherent superpositions in other words

quantum superpositions of left movers

and right movies which means they have

equal probability for either ok equal

probability for either so a particle at

rest is a linear coherent superposition

of left mover and right mover and a

massive particle in general contains

both left moving components and right

moving components as I emphasized it

does not mean two particles it means one

particle with a probability of 1/2 in

this case for being left moving away

when you look at it and see how fast

it's moving its correct it's at rest its

got your honor when I say it's a left

mover or right mover I mean to say that

if you didn't have this term in the

equation that it would be moving to the

left or the right its components the way

you it's um it's matrix components in

the original equation describe left

movers and right movers in the new

equation with the in term it describes

something at rest yeah you shouldn't

think of it as a coherent superposition

of something moving to the right and

something to moving to the left they're

both at rest or the whole thing is at

rest but they are uh okay here's the way

to say it if that mass term were not

there and I applied sigh right plus I

left to the vacuum then it would make a

coherent superposition of a particle

flying off to the left and a particle

flying off to the right

the master modifies the whole thing

significantly and it simply makes a wave

which just sits there it's neither going

to the left not the right it just sits

there but it's made up out of these same

objects the upper component and the

lower component okay so that's how you

make a massive Fermi on all massive

fermions

in in particle physics are built out of

left movies and right movers yeah you

see what it'd be like a 1 over square

root of 2 over there

what's great yeah it doesn't matter

because it's a yeah you could even put a

square sure there's a combination of

phase actually matter exactly what they

are they're just a number of equations

that would be basically the same

there you go a quarter the just ignoring

the square root of two doesn't drink

your breakfast will be swear to global

side I'm just saying the definition of

side plus + sign - have to have

basically same size right left yes yes

Kotori you're asking about the relative

size of it for a particle at rest for a

particle at rest but they have a

different page could you please walk

we have only real coefficients there

could there be common in fact we do and

that's a consequence of beta having been

chosen to be a real matrix all right

there are other choices of beta that one

could have chosen or the only rule about

beta was that it was an object which

can't I commuted with alpha and whose

square was one it is not unique but once

you choose it you choose it once you

choose it you stick with it but and

they're all equivalent they're all

equivalent to each other but as a

consequence of the particular choice of

beta the coefficient here is 1

had I chosen other choices there might

be some phases in there just

[Music]

really moving to my location

it's it's got things which were labeled

are in L which when the mass term wasn't

there really correspond at the left

moving or right moving waves now once

the mass term is there we might we might

give up the the the idea that it's

composed of left moving and right moving

waves that would it it is misleading to

think of it as left moving or right

moving waves it's just a way that's not

moving at all but it's built out of the

same mathematical objects which were

left movies and right movers when there

was no mass that's a mouthful the best

thing to do is to play with it and

perhaps once there's a mass term give up

R and L meaning right and left and mean

something else by them are NL the upper

component and the lower

so given the restaurant needs to have so

far this is a one-dimensional particle

that doesn't have angular momentum

because angular momentum doesn't make

sense in only one direction and only one

dimension so we have not gotten two

angular momentum yet which I'm trying

but I'm not going to make it so all the

wave function is the Fermi on creation

annihilation operators yes it does

we started the differential equation

started with his first order in time in

space yes if we were going after bosons

what what are we ordered the Fermi on

this previous side for me I'll type the

creation okay that's about it but but

the point is with this kind of equation

let's specifically this kind of equation

you have no choice but to quantize it

with the rules of fermions because

otherwise you'll have this terrible

problem of an unstable vacuum we will we

have we have not done relativistic

bosons yet and we need to historically

of course the Dirac equal no I'm not

sure which the klein-gordon equation I

think came before the Dirac equation but

though yeah you can make it the rest

removes the

in that upper box there moves that term

just to the right of the equation so

that you end up with the one lower box

in other words it is the lower box

essentially the same as the other box

but for in a different coordinate system

yeah

a coordinate system which is dropping by

inverting the x-axis now I'm talking

about the lower box on this on the lower

or here the box box box ah here that one

compared to the one above yes the box

above right in the upper box about that

but those two boxes yeah I'm wondering

if you can go from the box up the upper

box to the lower box by a Lorentz

transformation oh you mean I I know what

you mean I mean supposing we wrote down

the equation for a non zero momentum yes

and solve it then could you get to the

equation with zero momentum by Lorentz

transformation yes but I would have to

tell you how Lorentz transformations act

on sy which I haven't done just

wondering with some sense or another as

as the box above ends in if you add

Lorentz transformations that's right if

you say alright this is the theory of

electrons at rest and now let's Lorentz

transform them in satuay s that's

correct but I but you would have to know

how to transform sorry yeah that's

correct yeah so this that's right that's

that's another interpretation of class

so something is nothing to British North

masses that it comes from the

interaction with East Boston how does it

relate to this

okay I will tell you there

all right um good let me just be very

brief about it at this point

how what's the connection between this

formulation of a mass and the idea that

Higgs fields give particles mass

fermions mass alright so I'll tell you

um the equations of motion for the

fermion fields and the Higgs field the

Higgs field is another field let's call

it Phi let's call a Phi of X and it's a

scalar field it's a scalar field

whatever it is Phi of X the equations of

motion

first of all contain an equation of

motion for Phi let's not worry about

what it is but the Dirac equation

becomes a nonlinear equation and it

becomes a nonlinear equation in which

there's a coupling constant here and a

Phi a coupling constant and a Phi no

mass the Dirac electron has no mass and

if the vacuum was such that the field

Phi were equal to zero as you normally

would think in the vacuum empty space y

must be equal to zero right okay if that

were the case then looking at the

electron in a vacuum in a empty space

where Phi was equal to zero this

wouldn't be there and you would just

have the massless electron but if for

some reason for some reason the

energetics of the Higgs field favored

the lowest energy having a nonzero value

of Phi let's say a constant nonzero

value of Phi Phi of X equaling a

constant let's just call it Phi

that's what the vacuum if that's what

the empty space will like it was filled

with Phi then Phi here would just be the

constant value and all of this would

play the role of the mass so you have an

equation the mass of the electron is

equal for the coupling constant times

the magnitude of times the value of the

higgs field in the vacuum that's the

that's the connection we we've said it

that is the connection so any place that

this can come from it will provide a

mass in particular one place it could

come from is nonlinear equations

including couplings between bosons and

fermions and for some reason the bosonic

field having a value in the vacuum in

empty space and one of the things that

always seem I give evidence for is there

is and can you say more about how how

they expect that away well yeah okay so

we could talk a little more about it

right now

I was I was going to go into the 3 plus

1 dimensional Dirac equation but since

you asked let's let's discuss it a

little bit the Higgs field is a boson ik

field and bosonic fields qualify they

have potential energy they first of all

have energy which depends on the

gradients of the field are both space

gradients and time gradients not let's

not worry about that they also have

energy which just depends on the value

of the field itself the Maxwell field R

for example has energy which is e

squared plus B squared electric field

squared plus magnetic field squared now

both the electric field and the magnetic

field are proportional to derivatives of

the vector potential time derivatives

and space derivatives so in that case

all of the energy is associated with

gradients of fields for the Higgs field

there are for a scalar field you can

have an energy which is a sort of

called put the potential energy of the

field reify it does not depend on e the

space derivatives of time derivatives

and energy density it's an energy

density in the field and in principle

unless you have some deep principles to

guide you this V of Phi could be

anything any reasonable function of Phi

e okay now there are some symmetries for

the case of the Higgs field for example

one symmetry is that Phi a positive and

negative Phi are identical to each other

there's a symmetry of Phi becomes minus

Phi symmetric and that means that V of

Phi should be a symmetric function why

why I say that it's not important right

now

this is true so it means it should be a

symmetric function on the left and right

if it has a bulge over here should have

a bulge over here now for whatever

reason where the reasons are still not

completely settled completely via Phi is

a function which looks like this why

that is so as I said nobody really knows

why it's so but you pick a function one

function is as good as another it has to

be symmetric but that's all and from

what we know about the laws of particle

physics it appears that the potential

energy of the Higgs boson looks like

this here's as Phi is Phi equals zero

and the minimum of the potential is it's

some nonzero values of Phi e either over

here or over here you get the pick one

is it here or is it here okay so if the

potential look like that you would say

the minimum was at the origin if that

were the case the vacuum value of Phi

the state of lowest energy the state of

lowest potential energy would have Phi

equal to zero and the electron will have

no mass okay if for some

reasons the field potential looks like

this then the state of lowest energy

will either be over here or over here

there will be two configurations which

will otherwise be the identical one with

positive value of the field one with

negative value of the field either of

them give rise to a mass here either of

them give rise to a mass of V of G times

Phi and you know you can start asking

why did Nature choose to have a field

potential which looks like this not

completely clear at the moment okay but

see our real vacuum is over here let's

assume now the field can be over here in

the vacuum but it can also be perturbed

it can oscillate about here just like a

particle and a potential that can

vibrate back and forth the Higgs field

can vibrate it can have a frequency what

corresponds to a vibrating Higgs field

right the frequency of the Higgs field

is related to the mass of the Higgs

particle and the excitations of the

Higgs field in which it's oscillating

are like any other oscillation come in

quanta those quanta are the Higgs

particle so the Higgs particles

correspond to oscillations in here but

if the Higgs particle is very massive it

means it takes a lot of energy to get

this field starting to vibrate in the

vacuum it just sits there the electron

has a mass okay if it's that's the

vibrate that's a Higgs particle now if

the Higgs field is coupled in an

interesting dynamical way to the

electron field then by the laws of

action and reaction which I'm not going

to be terribly specific about now the

Higgs field will react to collisions of

fermions

a collision of fermions will stop the

Higgs field vibrating it'll stop the

Higgs field bright vibrating and create

Higgs particles they leave these

oscillations how much energy does it

take it depends on the mass of the Higgs

particle if the Higgs particle is very

massive it means it takes an enormous

amount of energy to excite one Quantum's

worth of vibration in here so if a Higgs

particle is massive it means you've got

to collide electrons with a lot of

energy to get it vibrating once it's

vibrating those vibrations are the

quanta of the Higgs field so the quant

that the Higgs field is itself a

legitimate quantum oscillating object

which is described by quanta as quanta

are called the Higgs particle and they

are coupled to the electron and other

fermion fields quark fields and so forth

in such a way that a collision of two

Fermi on fields can start the Higgs

field vibrating okay action in reactions

in case it kicks you starts vibrating

would it cause it's or must to change

yes yeah yeah yes you could get the

Higgs field now if you could get the

Higgs field to move an appreciable

amount for example if you could somehow

get the Higgs field they get in balance

up here and hold it there the electron

would have no mass all right now this

takes huge amounts of energy you could

to create a region of space and to hold

it there where the Higgs field is up

here would require an enormous amount of

energy so much energy that if you try to

make that region big enough to do an

experiment in which you create a black

hole so it's very difficult to arrange

for a region of space to have a Higgs

field sufficiently displaced so that you

could see an appreciable change in the

mass of the electron but yes the answer

is yes electron a quark or anything else

the answer is yes that that a

displacement of the Higgs field would

respond to a effectively a shift in the

mass of the electron so what what is the

reason we think there is an extreme and

mass hmm no we don't think there's only

one necessarily so inspired goal for

Johnson for speech and their own no in

the standard model of particle physics

is one Higgs and it does the work for

all of the particles electrons or quarks

and so forth and a supersymmetric

version of it there are two one of them

for for upcourt well is this too but no

more than two and it's not that one is

for electrons and one is for quarks it's

a little more complicated than that in

some ways more complicated and in some

ways simpler so the super symmetric

theory there are two Higgs bosons in a

regular ordinary theory there's only one

and the Higgs field is a little more

complicated than this I didn't give it

its full glory but I gave you the basic

idea that that the Higgs particle is an

oscillation at the bottom of this

potential well the shift of the Higgs

field in the vacuum is the origin of the

mass of the electron and and the quarks

and the real question is why do you have

to go to such lengths why don't you just

give the electron in the equations a

mass in the hell with the Higgs field

and that has a lot to do with the weak

interactions and and unification or not

in the supersymmetric case there are the

two big particles anti particles no no

no no not really um it just is one which

gives mass to up quarks and the other

one which gives mass to down quarks and

electrons and it's a little funny I mean

it's a technical feature of

supersymmetric theories which in itself

is not terribly interesting you are not

not terribly conceptually interesting

it's just to keep all the symmetries and

everything you're forced to throw in to

Higgs bosons it's funny to my mind one

of the ugly features of supersymmetric

theories but it may be true ugly or not

so question if the eggs particle has

mass where does that mass culture from

the exponents yeah we're getting in over

our heads now because much of this no no

I mean we want to we want to take it

easy where does the Higgs mass come from

nobody knows at the moment the real

question is not why the Higgs particle

has a mass the real question honestly is

why the Higgs particle mass is so small

okay the there are symmetries involved

in this whole story symmetries are very

important to the story let's suppose we

had a a reason to believe that that

there was a symmetry let's see what

though what is the symmetry

let's come back to it let's come back to

it this is an interesting model to

explain to understand the relation

between symmetries and particle masses

let's come back to it but I will tell

you that the basic symmetry I'm thinking

about is this left-right symmetric

symmetry here if the vacuum was

left-right symmetric it would mean left

right now doesn't mean in space it means

in filled space here then it would mean

the vacuum value of the field will have

to be zero and the mass of the electron

would have to be zero so it's the

breaking of symmetry which is what

provides the mass of the electron now

many of the particles the basic

structure of the theory is such that

there are symmetries which would tell

you that if the vacuum was symmetric

those particles would have to be

massless and they only can get a mass by

virtue of the vacuum being asymmetric

like that that is all of the particles

that we know all of the particles that

we know of with the exception of one

namely the photon get their mass or

would be massless would not have mass if

the Higgs field was at the center here

the photon is an exception only because

it doesn't have any mass it's not an

exception it has no mass but all the

particles that have mass have mass

because the Higgs field is not at the

center um that's where the oh I'm sorry

there is one exception apart from the

photon the Higgs particle itself the

Higgs particle itself could have a mass

even if it didn't have an offset like

this so the Higgs particle gets its mass

from a totally different mechanism than

electrons quarks z bosons W bosons all

those other particles have mass because

of a mechanism like this only the Higgs

boson gets its mass from some other

mechanism but we don't we haven't gotten

far enough yet to discuss that we'll

come to it

the graviton hmm the graviton center of

mass now I'm gonna have with the Higgs

particle

Higgs field it has a mixed credit

function okay there's like a program

where program photon and harmony is

number one when now the photon is not

unique as Erick mass right the graviton

is the only other in carry this year

well we don't know that it's the only

other one it's only of the of the known

of the known objects in nature the only

things which move with the speed of

light are photons and gravitons of known

things at one time it was thought that

neutrinos are massless but we now know

that neutrinos have a tiny little bit of

mass which means that this is left-right

coupling between them it's very small

now why it's so small there's another

question and we'll try to get to these

things but so we talked about the four

of them into the three them 3 plus 1

dimensional Dirac equation yeah the

pattern the pattern is what's once you

understand this the pattern is very

similar

again particles are described or fields

waves are described by a frequency and a

wave vector the wave number becomes a

wave vector which is proportional to the

momentum of a particle the wave vector

has components KX KY and KZ and Dirac

began by writing down a generalization

actually you I can write the same

equation Omega equals remember what it

was alpha times K was your - I think I

had a minus in there - alpha times K and

directs it let's generalize this oh plus

beta m plus theta m again standing for a

particular equation a particular

differential equation time derivatives

space derivatives and just mass did I

leave out the - let's see we're not sure

I've lost track of whether this should

be a minus there or not maybe not no no

- take it back no - I take it back no -

at all

okay omega equals alpha k plus beta m

now there ax read look let's try this in

three-dimensional space I have three

components of momentum a caused momentum

arrow and therefore I have to have three

components of alpha if it better be of

the form let's call it alpha 1 k 1 plus

alpha 2 k 2 plus alpha 3 K 3 three

components of k k one two and three now

in x y&z alpha 1 k 1 plus alpha 2 k 2

plus alpha 3 k 3 is the natural

generalization of this plus beta m he

started out with this a that's the most

general linear thing I can write down

it's nice and simple let's see if we can

do business with an equation like this

with alpha and beta x' being matrices in

such a way that Omega squared is equal

to K squared plus M Squared we will

require Omega squared equals KX squared

or k1 squared plus k2 squared plus K 3

squared plus M Squared

that's relativity all right now of

course there's more to relativity than

just this equation but it started with

that so let's try that let's see if we

can do business with that hmm good it's

somebody saying something but I can hear

what it is ok all right so let's just

square it Omega squared what are we

going to get let's just multiply alpha 1

K 1 plus alpha 2 K 2 plus alpha 3 K 3

plus beta M you know why he chose this

particular form as a historical factor

was simple it was nice and simple and

[Music]

let's try it it was in that spirit let's

try it and see what we get

all right so first of all we're going to

get things like alpha 1 squared k 1

squared we're going to have similar

things Val for 2 squared K 2 squared

alpha 3 squared plus K 3 squared it's

pretty obvious we had better choose all

of the squares the square of each alpha

to be equal to 1 okay so we can write

that then alpha sub I squared equals 1

for 1 for alpha for I equals 1 2 & 3 the

square of each alpha matrix each one of

them has to be 1 that's the first

condition let's let me write it up here

alpha 1 squared equals alpha 2 squared

equals alpha 3 squared equals 1 all 3 of

them now

what about beta when we multiply beta

squared we're also going to want to

match ah where's the yeah we're going to

want to match this so also beta squared

it better be equal to 1 we're going to

get some other terms we're going to get

terms for example which have k1 times k2

they'll come from two places

we'll have k1 k2 from these two terms

can everybody see it okay but will also

get terms from these two terms same term

k1 k2 so what will we have for k1 k2

will have K 1 K 2 will have alpha 1

alpha 2 plus alpha 2 alpha 1 what we

want to do with that zero got to be 0

and more generally the anti commutator

of two alphas had better be 0 if they're

not the same if they're not if they

don't have the same index okay so we

have alpha I alpha J plus alpha J alpha

I equals 0 i not equal to j for i equal

to j it has to be 1 so you can write

this in the form if you like it would be

our notation alpha I alpha J plus alpha

J alpha re equals Delta

Rjay another way of saying 0 when re not

equal to j1 when R equals 2 J what about

the terms which have products for

example K times M we're going to have K

times M K 1 times M K 1 times M from

here and K 1 duck out of the way K 1 and

times M from here and K 1 times M from

here

all right so we'll also have to have

each one of the alphas plus dot dot dot

plus K 1 m alpha 1 beta plus beta alpha

1 we have to have the alphas all anti

commute with beta okay so we have to

have for every alpha alpha I beta plus

beta alpha I must equal zero if we can

satisfy these relations for matrices all

together three alphas and one beta

very symmetric every one of them anti

commutes with any other one the ball

four of them this is symmetric if the

four matrices first of all they all have

to square to one they all have to anti

commute with each other and that's it

basically if we can find for such

matrices then we can find a wave

equation of the same column matrix type

which will give us in four dimensions

three plus one dimensions will give us

Omega squared equals K squared plus M

Squared

so Dirac set himself the task of finding

a collection of four matrices which

satisfy this rule his first observation

must have been a little bit of a

disappointment is that you can't do it

with two by two matrices you can find

three matrices of the right form which

are square to 1 and which mutually

anti commute in this way you can find

three of them the three poly matrices

but there is no fourth one and so first

attempt failure I don't know if it's

direct first attempt you probably knew

this so intuitively that it didn't even

bother but the the first case where you

can have matrices which satisfy this is

in four not four dimensions of

space-time that's not the point

4x4 matrices 4x4 matrices there are 4x4

matrices which satisfy all of these

conditions there are no 3x3 and no

two-by-two matrices just first case is

4x4 matrices so there actor it out

before by four matrices which which

satisfy these rules I'm going to give

them to you I'm going to tell you what

they are you can study them yourself I'm

not going to do the details 4x4 matrices

would satisfy these rules they are

called of course the Dirac matrices

incidentally that raises a puzzle from

the beginning the two-by-two matrices

corresponding had something to do with

moving left and moving right okay

what are these 4x4 matrices what are the

four possibilities associated with the

four matrices and that's something we'll

come to I think next time I don't think

we'll do that tonight

but the new ingredient is spin that okay

and we're going to have to learn a

little bit about angular momentum before

we can learn about spin okay so let me

tell you what the minimal set of

matrices are not unique we're not unique

up to some simple transformations but

they're equivalent not unique but

equivalent in the same sense that I can

pick if I'm interested in mutually

orthogonal axes in space mutually

orthogonal axes are not unique there's

another set of mutually orthogonal axes

they're not unique but they are

equivalent in that the laws of physics

in an either set of axes are the same

and you can make transformations from

one to the other in the same sense the

choice of Dirac matrices is not unique

but equivalent and here's a particular

solution

okay so beta is equal to 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

0 0 minus 1 0 0 0 0 minus 1 ok that's

beta now before I write the others I

want to simplify well maybe yeah I think

I'll write them without simplifying the

notation ok that's beta alpha 1

and of course it's your job to go home

and check these algebraic relations okay

zero zero zero zero R 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0

0 0 0 alpha 2 equals 0 0 0 0 now I could

start saving myself work by just

dividing these things into 2 by 2

structures and call each one of these

give each one of these 2 by 2 matrices a

name but I'll do that next time

ah here goes alpha 2 anybody know what

comes next

- I I zero and then here we have 0 minus

I I 0 and then 0 0 0 0 alpha 3 surely

you can guess somebody want to take a

stab at it now 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 minus 1 0

1 0 0 minus 1 0 0 0 0

more nifty notation is to divide things

into blocks of two-by-two matrices all

right each one a block of two-by-two

matrices and then write them in the form

beta is equal to the unit of call I for

identity or unit matrix here unit 2 by 2

matrix 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 minus I when each

entry is now a 2 by 2 matrix ok and

alpha is equal to 0 Sigma Sigma 0 when

these matrices are the three poly

matrices the 3 poly matrices if you

don't know what they are here they are

Sigma 1 Sigma 2 and Sigma 3 we're going

to come back to these matrices they're

very important ok these objects satisfy

the Dirac anti commutation relations and

if you write a wave equation what would

the wave equation be the equate equation

would be um let's write it down you

first of all make a 4 component sigh so

I one side to side 3 so 4 corresponding

to the 4 by 4 matrix entries and you

write that derivative of sy with respect

to T times I is equal to minus alpha I

with an I derivative of sy with respect

to X I X I means x y&z this means alpha

1 times derivative with respect to

xr4 - derivative of respect to Y and so

forth summed over I and then plus beta M

sign that's the famous Dirac equation

and it stands for four equations four

equations in which the components get a

good deal more mixed up than in the one

in the in the easier case the one

dimension they get more mixed up because

there's a lot of off diagonal matrix

elements here that means when they're

off diagonal means the matrix elements

get mixed up the different components in

a fairly intricate way but still it's a

coupled set of linear differential

equations for four components where the

matrices sort of entangle or entangles

technical terms you can use it where the

where the matrices couple the various

components together it's called the

Dirac equation we will come back to it

and the next time we'll discuss where

spin comes from where a spin comes from

is the extra doubling if you like our

the size of the matrix see that sort of

function is the mo here we have an M

over here run away the C so actually I

try to think of it as a kind of a four

vector type of a thing it's not enough

for vectors the spinners they're not for

vectors the four component objects but

they're not for vectors the four here is

not the same as saying that space has

four dimensions it happened in the

previous case that space time had two

dimensions and the matrices were 2x2

however that was just an accident and in

this case it's also an accident as you

go between different dimensions the

matrices get

fast and not the not the same

dimensionality as a space they're always

even dimensional and they're always of

dimension 2 to the N in any dimension in

any dimension of space the size of the

matrices rose to power so the basic

structure and we had some n sayang on

one term and some sort of momentum on

the other curve so the momentum where

that's right where some sort of momentum

on the other term but where the matrices

mix up the components in some slightly

intricate way that's again interesting

to study the case with no momentum of a

particle at rest and then it just has

this and if you notice beta has two

positive entries into negative entries

it means that there are positive energy

states and negative energy states same

deal same deal fill up the negative

energies

Alfre equation alpha I 0 Sigma I Sigma

AI 0 yeah - in the left left left off

for left or right for the yeah oh is

there a to your right you are right

there is a 2 here thank you

why is there a 2 there let's see alpha 1

squared should be 1 but this is

obviously if both I and J 1 this is

alpha 1 squared plus alpha 1 squared

which is 2 that's right there is a 2

boy was it absolutely yes sir I mean

until Dirac wrote down this equation

anti particles had never been heard of

spin had being been heard of but nobody

knew where it came from

what Dirac he postulated this equation

and then tracked down its consequences

and one of the consequences was anti

particles the other consequence was spin

like it or not spin was there so yes

that's right

is it a similar story to imaginary about

the theorem of relativity and quantum

mechanics giving us from younger guys

there's more the empirical of all we

hurt oh yes no the theorem the theorem

was much later and it keeps getting in

as with all theorems there are

assumptions that you begin with and

sometimes in the beginning the

assumptions were let's just take free

fields which meant fields which didn't

interact with other fields completely

linear equations and see what's possible

I was proved in that case and then

people studied coupled fields and and

got more and more elaborate the theorem

[Music]

by now I don't think anybody doubts that

the only possibilities of bosons

incidentally this is a statement about

three dimensional space one dimension of

time relativity in three dimensions of

space one dimension of time in two

dimensions of space in one dimension of

time it's different

there are things which canter pallate

between bosons and fermions and they're

interesting but in four dimensions

that's it

both bosons and fermions and that's all

for the subscript of Sai for the four

components of Sai your customary index

well sure are what should we call the

index we'll need a label oh look a name

it I mean I don't want to use I because

we've used I at least twice in this

equation at least twice in this equation

we can we can fix that square root of -1

right um now there's I but I would not

want this I labels what what is this I

Space 1 XY and Z but now there's also a

label here so what should I call alpha

let's call it oh boy we've already used

alpha M and then so okay there isn't a

customary one oh you did you okay so

this is P the matrices themselves have

two indices P Q and this would be Q and

this would also be P Q and this would be

Q and in this case P and Q would run

from 1 to 4

you really need those in because you

make sure yeah but if you wanted to know

where all the hidden indices are on

things and there's a symmetric way to

write this equation so that it looks

more relativistic and maybe I'll write

it down next time basically

yeah there's a more symmetric way to

write it but this does the trick in any

case that's the Dirac equation or its

simplest incarnation and next time what

did I say we would do next time

spin-spin-spin and the wave fields for

relativistic bosons doing that we will

be ready to start to talk about real

particle physics we need to talk about

what the theory of bosons is like you

know but half the particles in nature

are bosons and the Dirac equation is not

the right description for them we need

to talk about that a little bit and then

we move on to quarks leptons z bosons

expos ons no no expose on the Y bosons

Higgs bosons photons and and try to make

a little bit of order out of the mess

[Music]

good ok

symmetries we have to talk about
