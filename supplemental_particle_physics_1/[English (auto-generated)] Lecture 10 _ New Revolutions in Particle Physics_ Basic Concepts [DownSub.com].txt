all right last time I started to tell

you something about how quantum field

theory gives rise to a theory of the

particle interactions through an object

called the Lagrangian I think that was

not terribly clear so I want to go back

through it a little bit before starting

to discuss the detail the details of

particle physics we're still thinking

about quantum field theory the basic

technique that I was a that I was

alluding to last time is called the path

integral method of quantum mechanics and

it is the most direct route the Fineman

diagrams to the theory of particle

interactions that are based on Fineman

diagrams so let me just try to briefly

go through the basic ideas which we

started to do last time but I don't

think I was sufficiently clear anyway

the path integral formalism or method in

quantum mechanics do to find min is a

generalization as the quantum mechanical

version of the principle of least action

so I just want to remind you what the

principle of least action is if we're

talking about a particle now I don't

mean a particle from the particle

physics quantum field theory point of

view just a classical Newtonian particle

the motion of a classical Newtonian

particle from one point the space-time

to another just very quickly is

determined by a Lagrangian Lagrangian as

a function of the coordinates of the

particle the time derivatives of the

particle and from the Lagrangian

whatever the Lagrangian is one

constructs the action and the action is

an integral along the trajectory of

article of the lagrangian for every

trajectory whether it's the true

trajectory or not the true trajectory

from here to here by the true trajectory

I mean the solution of Newton's

equations from one space-time point to

another space-time point whether or not

the trajectory is a solution it has an

action the integral of the Lagrangian

along the orbit the classical principle

of least action is that the trajectory

followed by the particle through

space-time minimizes the action from

that you can derive differential

equations and those differential

equations are called Newton's equations

and I will assume that you know a little

bit about this idea of action now the

same idea applies to classical field

theory and the way the idea works is for

a particle for an ordinary particle

motion the Lagrangian is a function

along an orbit a function of an orbit

for a field theory and of course it's an

orbit which connects some initial

configuration to a final configuration

for a field theory the equations of

motion of a field theory classical

equations of motion are also determined

from a Lagrangian the Lagrangian is a

function of whatever fields I'll call

them generically just fine and not just

the time derivatives of the fields but

the space derivatives and the time

derivatives let's say derivative of Phi

with respect to X view that's just this

is just a shorthand way of saying that

the Lagrangian depends on Phi and

derivatives of Phi one thing which is

required by the theory of relativity is

that the lagrangian be a scalar by a

transform on the Lorentz transformations

as a scalar but that being said the

Lagrangian can be anything built out of

Phi's and derivatives

five what is the action imagine we have

a region of space time time as usual

flows upward space is horizontal and we

have a region of space time between an

initial time and a final time then the

action in this region the action is the

action in this region just as the action

for a particle trajectory is the action

from one endpoint of the trajectory to

another here it's the action in a

regional space between an initial

configuration and a final configuration

and the action is equal to the integral

over that region let's write a D 4x

which means the time and the X and the y

and DZ of this Lagrangian so it's the

total integrated value of the Lagrangian

over space and time whereas for the

particle is just an integral over time

now what do you do what's the analog of

a starting point for the particle a

value of the field on the initial

surface here given not just one field

but all the fields in the problem

prescribing the values of the field on

the initial surface here and prescribing

the values of the fields on the final

surface you can ask is there a solution

of the equations of oh let me go back a

step forget that yes is there a solution

of whatever the equations of the theory

are which starts with a given initial

value of the fields at time T equals

zero let's say and ends with the fields

being something different that some

later time and the answer is the

principle of least action again the

equations of the theory are formulated

by saying yes there always doesn't exist

something in between which is a correct

solution of the theory which has a given

initial value of the fields here and a

given value of the fields at the

endpoint and the correct solution of the

fields in here is the one which minimize

is this action one which minimizes the

action so the principle of least action

gets extended to a kind of space-time

principle of least action with the

degrees of freedom in here are fields

okay now let me very quickly remind you

what the quantum mechanical use of

action is how exactly you derive the

classical principle of least action from

the quantum mechanical version of

fineman's quantum mechanical version we

won't we don't really need to get into

here you can go look it up and I need

anything about path integrals but for a

particle let's come back to the particle

motion for a moment according to fine

min or according to quantum mechanics a

thing that you might want to calculate

is the amplitude is there anything wrong

with the value of a field returning to

itself oh no no no more than the

possibility of the position of this

thing occurring to itself so how do you

how do you go from one space-time event

to another space-time with Y space-time

events having values of fields here and

values of fields here

well integrating V for X so there has to

be some d4 trajectory though the

trajectory is replaced by a history a

history of the field from the beginning

to the end a history means the values of

the fields all along here everywhere is

in here okay the idea of a trajectory

becomes a trajectory in field space

which means we have to specify actually

the for the coordinates as well as the

field guides to get an initial point

well we're you're specifying the initial

boundary condition or whatever as fields

out field values all along some initial

surface you pick the initial surface in

other words you pick time it's the whole

field along some cross sectional yeah

all right which is another way of saying

the end of the whole field at a given

instant of time and the final

configuration is the whole field at some

later our time and the question is is

there a solution of the theory whatever

the theory is which interpolates in

between these in the same way that a

trajectory interpolates from here to

here the rule is minimize the action

that in that if carried out we do it

that we did this number of classes ago

but if that's carried out the

requirement of minimizing the action

leads the partial differential equations

for the fields and those partial

differential equations are things like

Maxwell's equations things like

Einstein's equations and so forth all

right so let's come back now to the

quantum mechanical idea the quantum

mechanical idea has to do with

amplitudes amplitudes are things out of

which you construct probabilities so for

example you can ask the question what is

the amplitude that if a particle is

injected into the world

however it's injected in at a spacetime

point X and T what is the amplitude that

I look for in a later time let's say

this is of X and time T what's the

amplitude that if I look at a later time

let's call it T prime that I will find

it at position X Prime and T prime so

it's the amplitude that if I start a

particle at this point close my eyes for

a while and then

turn on a detector which looks for the

particle at a certain place the

amplitude for finding it there that

amplitude is a complex number that

depends on the initial point on the

final point it's a complex number whose

magnitude squared is the probability

alright that's a rule square the

amplitude or multiply it by its complex

conjugate and that is the amp that is

the probability for the particle to go

from here to here fineman's rule is the

following it says take the action for

any trajectory take an arbitrary

trajectory and write down the expression

e to the I minus I the action of the

trajectory we can just write it out it's

integral of now we're talking about

particles now integral of the Lagrangian

DT from one point to another point it's

a function of our functional of the

trajectory and now actually the factor

of h bar in here a factor of h bar in

here that's where quantum mechanics

comes into it some this or integrate it

over all possible trajectories well in

nonrelativistic quantum mechanics you

don't let them go backward in time but

all possible trajectories which never

loop back in there with on themselves in

time some that over all the possible

trajectories the each trajectory it's a

complex number add them all up now how

do you add up such a thing and some

complicated kind of integral but we

needn't worry too much about the details

of how you actually calculate it that

according to Fineman is the amplitude

for going from here to here it's the sum

of all possible classical roots

classical root does not mean a so

question of the equations it just means

a possible route its sum of all possible

routes whether or not the solutions of

the equations of Newton's equations of e

to the minus I times the action measured

in plunks constant units incidentally

Planck's constant has units of action so

this is simply the action in units of

the Planck's constant the e rises

because they because to go a little step

involves e something very funny one plus

an act term and the action you have to

multiply to these yes well right exactly

that's exactly right and the other thing

here is the I the I is part of quantum

mechanics so I kind of say yeah

that sum is the thing whose square is

the probability by square I mean times

its complex conjugate this sum could

hardly be a probability because in

general its complex it's got an I in it

you multiply it by its complex conjugate

that is the probability this is the

probability amplitude the complex thing

so this is fineman's formulation of

quantum mechanics and then it can be

extended the quantum field theory in

quantum field theory the corresponding

question now we're not actually going to

formulate it this way because but this

is a correct way to formulate it we're

going to we're going to fudge it a

little bit and make our way through it

without without any rigor but the same

idea you start with an arbitrary

configuration of the field all right so

that's some initial Phi of X X now being

just X and not T an initial

configuration of the field and now you

look at some final configuration of the

field let's call Phi prime of X and

these are two different functions and

you can ask what is the probability

amplitude that if I start the field at

some value and let the system go and

then detect the field at a later time

imagine you had some way of starting an

initial condition with a field being

prescribed at every point of space of

course that's an idealization you don't

have a chance in the world of doing that

really but you had some sort of

apparatus which allowed you to start the

field in an arbitrary configuration let

it go and then you had another apparatus

which detects the values of the field at

every point then you can ask what is the

probability that if you start the field

in a given way that at a later time the

field will have some value again that

probability is determined in terms of a

probability amplitude and the

probability amplitude is again the sum

over all possible ways of interpolating

the field between initial and final all

possible what I said all possible ways

of filling in between the initial state

and the final state with a field value

at every point of e to the minus I h

times the field action that's the

integral DX DT DX dy DZ D 4x of the

lagrangian which is a function of Phi

and the derivatives of Phi so you

evaluate the lagrangian of every point

integrate it up that gives you the

action for a particular let's call it a

trajectory it's not really a trajectory

in any ordinary sense but it's a history

let's call it a history better yet for

each history each possible history that

you can imagine it doesn't have to be a

true history or a real history for every

possible history you can imagine there

is an action the action is itself an

integral but then you can sum this over

all possible histories and that is the

amplitude to start with a field value

Phi

end with a feel value Phi prime between

these two trajectories here okay that's

the notion of a path integral but the

action is going to be what's a finite

complex number right yeah so how can

that converse to any why is that

oh no there are many many integrals well

okay you're asking all right let me let

me phrase it let me phrase it little

more strongly adding up an infinite

number of numbers well that's that's

that's nothing special I think what

you're pointing out is that each one of

these numbers is not only finite but has

a magnitude equal to one it has a

magnitude equal to one all right it's an

exponential of I times something right

so any number like this is a number

which on the complex plane not

minimizing it you're summing over all

contagious summit sum over

all these failed amplitude okay yeah

these things do do converge they don't

they converge because they are because

of the oscillate they all lie on the

infant on the unit circle on the

infinite circle on the unit circle and

yet the integrals do converge for

example that's one example but there are

many examples are where integrals like

this converge the kind of thing that

can't converge well if you have an

infinite number of numbers all of which

are positive and you add them up

positive and bounded away from zero

you have an infinite number of numbers

all of them positive and bounded away

from zero of course that's going to

diverge okay in this case you have

numbers which can cancel over here as

one trajectory over here is another

trajectory over here is another

trajectory these are the amplitudes for

different trajectories and this one

cancels this one so it's not hard for an

integral where if they're equally

distributed around the unit circle then

you zero yeah

except for a small fraction of them they

are that's right they tend to cancel a

lot the only trajectories which tend not

to cancel are the ones near the

classical trajectory we won't do we

don't have to discuss that now but that

is the way that you go from quantum

mechanics the classical theory at least

in this formulation if you look for the

particular trajectories where you have

the least cancellation those are the

trajectories of stationary action the

star the trajectories where the action

is minimum but that that's that's

another story this is the quantum

mechanical path integral formulation

that much of modern field theory

basically all of modern field theory

quantum field theory is based on all

right now I'm not going to derive the

next step I'm simply going to state the

next step but I wanted to at least

explain to you what this quantity is

before I show you how in practice it's

used now when I say in practice this is

a bit of an oversimplification but not

too bad not too bad the last time we

talked a little bit about how the

Lagrangian is used to calculate

processes particles moving from one

place to another particles interacting

when I say calculate processes what did

I really mean I really meant calculate

the probability for an initial state to

go to a final state but there are two

distinct ways to think about relativists

well about filthy quantum field theory

one is in terms of fields and the other

is in terms of particles we know that

there is this duality between particles

and fields we could ask a totally

different apparently totally different

question instead of asking suppose you

had a given field value here then you

want to know what the amplitude is for a

final field

you we could ask supposing you had some

incoming particles quanta of the field

you express things in terms of field

quanta rather than in terms of classical

field configurations supposing I told

you that the field initially was in a

state which was described by a

particular collection of incoming

particles incidentally when I say the

field I may mean a collection of fields

all right so I tell you not the value of

the field along here but rather the

particle content coming in and I tell

you what the particle content is going

out and I ask you what's the probability

that you went from one particle content

to another particle content it's a

question of a similar kind of question

but expressed in terms of the particle

representation of quantum field theory

rather than the classical field

configuration and the answer not

surprisingly involves exactly this same

object okay we talked about a little bit

I think what I told you last time

there's nothing correct but it was a

little small piece of it I said what you

do is you took one I'll just remind you

of something I said and then I'm going

to say it again but in a more correct

way you take one plus the Lagrangian

remember what we did we said let's

divide up in space-time into lots of

little cells it's hard to give meaning

to objects like this like this path

integral directly the way to give

meaning to it is to divide up space into

lots of little cells and instead of

thinking about continuous functions or

even discontinuous functions think about

a value of the field in each one of

these cells all right that makes it more

concrete and then in the end you divide

you you let the size of the cells go to

zero so let's not let the size of the

cells go to zero let's

let's keep them finite like this what I

told you is that you take the quantity

one plus the Lagrangian in each cell and

the I cell or L sub I that's the value

of the Lagrangian in each cell and you

multiply it for all the cells remember I

said that if you don't doesn't matter

because we're going to say it again the

right way this time

and then you did we did something with

this to try to calculate and I tried to

show you that there are pieces in here

which describe the propagation of

particles the collisions of particles

we're going to go back over it again as

it really is central all right first of

all I missed being tired I was not

terribly clear it's really 1 minus I

times the Lagrangian in each cell okay

now 1 minus I 1

what's 1 plus a small this is for the

moment imagine this is a small quantity

I shouldn't actually it's not 1 plus the

Lagrangian it's 1 plus the action in

each cell now the action in each cell is

the Lagrangian times the space start

times R times the space time volume in

each cell space-time volume is Delta X

Delta Y Delta Z times delta T for each

cell let's call that a small number

let's just call it the space-time volume

let's call it a to the fourth where a is

a small number and so each little cell

is small so the action in each cell is

itself small because the cell is small

now 1 minus a 1 plus a small quantity

let's call one plus epsilon is an

approximation to e to the epsilon

e to the epsilon is this is

approximately equal for small epsilon

but the exact formula is a power Series

in epsilon it's 1 plus epsilon plus

epsilon squared over 2 plus epsilon

cubed over what comes next

3 factorial which is 6 3 times 2 times 1

and so forth and so on

so 1 plus epsilon is approximately for

small things equal to e to the epsilon

but in fact it's more efficient and

incorrect to really write something

different than what I wrote over here

namely this thing

let's let's think about what this thing

is

in fact don't you have to put an H bar

and

here yeah I probably wind up setting a

cage bar equal to one as usual but right

okay what is this object arm this

exponential here what's in here we're

going to imagine replacing naught by an

integral but by a sum the integral of a

space and time here just imagine that

we've replaced it by the sum and what is

it the sum of it's the sum of the action

in every little cell right each when I

replace the sum of the integral by a sum

up in here when I replace the integral

by a sum up in here what I'm really

doing is just adding up the action in

all these little cells now the thing

about a exponential is that the

exponential of a sum is the product of

Exponential's e to the a plus B is e to

the a times e to the B so this can also

be written as an OA and another way if

we get the summation here for a minute

that's summing over paths before we do

that summing over history's what this

object is it's an exponential of a sum

so it's also the product of e to the

minus I over H bar a in the first cell

e2 the minus I over H bar action in the

second cell a is action e to the minus I

over H bar a and the third cell and it's

exactly this kind of product product

over all the cells not of one minus I

times the action but of e to the minus I

times the action they're close to each

other it actually wouldn't matter which

we used but

in practice but okay so let's now

consider question okay all right so now

having this form here let's go back to

what we get particles for a minute and

think about fields and reexpress

the path integral idea so here we have a

region of space-time that's been chopped

up into tiny little cells enough what's

the idea of an initial condition the

idea of initial condition is to start on

the first row of cells here and give the

value of the fields at every point in

there that's an initial condition no

that's the analog of an initial

condition a final condition is to

specify the fields in the last row so

the question then is what is the

probability amplitude that if a field is

specified in a certain way on the first

row and the field is specified in the

last row what's the probability to go

from one to another or the amplitude the

amplitude that if you started a certain

way and let the system run you will

later find it in the final state and the

final state now means the field in each

one of these cells here answer you take

e to the minus I times the sum of the

action and all the cells but we now

realize that this is simply the product

of e to the minus I of the action in

each cell we multiply together the

action in all of these cells for a given

history for a given history for a given

history which means a given value of the

fields in each cell and we multiply them

all together we compute

the exponential of the action and then

we sum it over all ways of populating

the cells with fields all possible

histories means all possible values of

the fields that could be in every cell

with the exception of the first lo in

the last row the first row in the last

row are fixed by the initial and final

conditions in other words by the oh by

the initial and final conditions we

don't look at the field in the interior

we simply start the system and then

detect it and the rule is sum over all

possible our field configurations that

could exist in between so that has

reduced this idea to a discrete form in

which we see that all we have here is

this infinite product or this product

over of actions all right now let's

let's try to formulate some ideas about

particles instead of asking the question

what if we start with a given field

configuration what if we start with a

given particle configuration and end

with a given particle configuration what

is the amplitude to go from one to the

other so I'll I'll tell you how you

think about it and then we're not going

to derive this we've talked about it a

good deal we've talked about the ideas a

good deal we've talked about the fact

that fields are made up of creation and

annihilation operators and what we're

multiplying together here is functions

of the fields functions of the fields

and therefore functions yeah I read

somewhere that someone thinks that yield

quanta are not necessarily identified

new particles right you wouldn't

disagree with that so I'm not sure I'm

not sure who and what was the context no

I'm not sure who said it and what the

context was well give me a little more

to go on

in question was somebody said something

my grandmother probably said it field

quanta in the quantum field theory are

not necessarily part I did identifiable

as as a particle the only thing I can

think of is that he was talking about

quarks and of course in some sense

quarks are particles but in some other

sense they're never detectable as

particles because they can never escape

from one another that's the only thing I

can think of so quarks are the quanta of

the quark field but they're never

directly detected as separate quarks

well separated from other quarks

that's the only thing I can think of

that it might be speaking about well I

guess during during unitary evolution

it doesn't necessarily boil down to

observables and so you may not have

particles that are identifiable with

intermediate states if you accept the

idea of a quark as a particle it's true

that there's not a one-to-one

correspondence necessarily between the

fields and a theory and the particles in

the friend the theory that's an idea

which is true as long as the coupling

constants in the theory are small okay

so there is not necessarily a one-to-one

correspondence yeah I mean it is true

there are field theories that for one

reason or another you wouldn't describe

their quanta as conventional particles

but you know at some level it's just the

difference between words if you define

particle to mean quanta then there's no

difference between them

they're indivisible very they carry

energy and so forth so for my money I

would call them particles but but yeah

is his son imitation what this place

no no no in fact they don't have to be

continuous first of all of course the

idea of continuity on a discrete space

like this doesn't quite mean very much

the field in the neighboring cell is

just going to be a different value of

the field the rule is the rule is divide

the space into cells and an actual

practice this is the way quantum field

theory is defined you divide the theory

into cells use sum of all possible ways

of arm populating the cells with values

of the fields all possible ways no

restriction to things which are

approximately continuous and in fact

quantum fields are not approximately

continuous they jiggle a great deal and

[Music]

you sum over all the possible values of

the fields and that's it so principle

for each field in each derivative you

can assign assign it all possible values

from minus infinity

well you don't assign the derivative

separately from the field the

derivatives of of course are related to

differences of the fields and

neighboring boxers so you populate with

field values and then derivatives are

replaced by yah we and you can use there

are different rules that you might adopt

you might define the derivative here to

be the difference of the field here and

here right yeah that's that's that's a

minor detail and

but in any event you you might take the

real line up and break it up into small

intervals but you'd still have a sum

over a countable number of here your

possible values of the field for what

for each field and if there were two

fields and you'd be doing that over yep

by defeated by the field here I mean all

of the fields right so you would give a

value to each possible field in the

theory at each this is really nasty

looking computation okay well so since

these are complex functions like their

analytic function so well there are

already functions of the relationships

between the values of the field have to

have to have to have to conform to you

know what you learn in complex variables

you know complex variables is about the

theory of analytic functions analytic

functions are extremely smooth they're

the smoothest functions you can think of

these functions do not have to be smooth

they're they're complex valued but

they're not analytic functions the field

as functions of position definitely not

there there on the average highly

discontinuous but

I want to do the computation on computer

oh how do I know never to do all right

yeah I mean how how many different ears

I have to consider I mean different

different assignments okay so of course

this this by now is a major industry

called lattice gauge theory Oh lattice

quantum field theory lattice because it

divides the world into a lattice and

this has been studied to death how how

to do these integrals in practice by now

it is a very effective tool but it took

you know some 30 years to develop the

computing technology I was involved in a

very very beginning very very beginning

I wasn't involved in the computer

technology of it but setting up the

rules for lattice gauge theory okay so

there was a history the first part of it

was setting up the rules for it and that

took about three weeks and then

something like 30 years to develop the

technology to compute these things and

you're right I mean you know how do you

know when you've when you've sampled

enough of the space okay so there are

and a lot of the wisdom of it came from

statistical mechanics where you do very

much the same thing you calculate

partition functions or probability

distributions for this this checkerboard

here not of quantum field theory it

could be a real crystal lattice and you

might be summing over configurations of

whether there is or isn't an electron in

each side so a lot of that methodology

came from the the quantitative study of

statistical mechanics systems we have

the same question how do you know when

you when you've sampled enough and this

is not the subject of

tonight's lecture so the answer is the

experts no but I think they know and

they get good answers they get good

answers which agree with experiments so

it's it's it seems to work okay so let's

let's go back and remember that quantum

fields are a shorthand for creation and

annihilation operators and if we're

talking about let's say the product of

some fields in this box times the fields

in this box that can represent the

annihilation of a particle in this box

and the creation of a particle in a

neighboring box so we might just

represent it by a particle moving from

one box to another what kind of things

in the action here actually do

correspond to a particle moving from one

box to another so let me tell you there

are things in the action here which

strictly speaking are not associated

with one box but with a pair of boxes

namely the derivative terms the

derivative terms I was a little bit

hasty here when I said you multiply all

these things together one for each box

as a little bit of a cheat because there

are terms in Lagrangian which are

associated with pairs of boxes so really

you can think of it as summing over the

boxes and summing over a neighboring

pairs of boxes but that's that's a

detail which terms involve pairs of

boxes the terms which involve pairs of

boxes are things like the derivative of

Phi with respect whoops with respect to

T squared the derivative of Phi on a

lattice becomes the de rhibs the

difference of Phi in neighboring boxes

so in here this derivative of Phi with

respect to T might really be written as

Phi at point X

well five point T and X minus Phi at

point neighboring time and X no

secondary these are first derivatives

never never bad idea

does real damage are

now what about derivatives with respect

to the spatial coordinates same thing it

corresponds to the dirt to the

difference two neighboring points in

space and then the instruction is to

take one half of the square of the

derivative

well one-half of the square of the

derivative will have in it I just want

to focus now on the terms which multiply

Phi times Phi in a neighboring point let

me just focus on those there's also

terms in here which multiplied by Phi by

the same by the presence of the value at

the same point but in particular there

are terms in this Lagrangian which

multiply Phi at one point times Phi in a

neighboring point every time you lay

down a term like this it represents the

motion of a particle from here to here

you can think of it that way okay let's

let's take let's concentrate on these

terms let's forget the interactions in

the Lagrangian these are simply these

are called the kinetic terms the

quadratic terms in the lagrangian

they're things which are easy to deal

with

and they do correspond to motion of the

particle from one point to another let's

look at this and let's include only

those let's

we don't even need to write it in this

form let's just write it as e to the

minus I times the sum of all pairs of

boxes of all neighboring pairs of boxes

I said over all boxes but it's clear

that's not quite right we want to think

of it as sums over neighboring pairs of

boxes of things like Phi and one box

times Phi in a neighboring box I'll use

the notation X and X prime to represent

neighbors on the lattice that's what

goes into the action or that's what goes

into the exponential of the action there

are some coefficients in front of it of

course but that's that's of secondary

importance and now we can expand out

this exponential let's see what's there

this is 1 minus I times the sum of Phi

of X Phi of X prime and then things like

let's see what's the next term I times I

is minus 1 so it looks like it's minus

summation of Phi of X Phi of X prime

squared times another factor of the sum

of Phi of X Phi of X prime well this

could be PI of X prime X double prime X

triple prime X double Prime and X triple

prime are one pair of neighbors this is

another pair of neighbors and I think I

left out a factor there should be a 2

factorial downstairs I'm simply

expanding out the exponential here and

what's the next one well it has three

powers of the sum four powers of the sum

and so forth okay let's look at each

term here the first term

has something which involves a sum over

the lattice of an annihilation of a

particle at one point and a creation of

enough particle at another point at a

neighboring point the next term Oh

incidentally the rule that I'm going to

tell you again I'm in the business of

telling you some rules now I'm going to

tell you some rules now the amplitude

for going from one thing to another the

rule is you've got to close or if you

must not have a dangling endpoint a

dangling end point can only dangle like

that if you've got an operation to put a

particle into the system a dangling

endpoint for example we're going to have

diagrams which have particles going from

one point to another if they end like

this they're illegal unless there's an

instruction to put a particle in at this

point and to take a particle out at that

point

so endpoints like this we will simply

rule out as things unless they

correspond to a specific instruction to

put a particle in at this point and take

it out since we're only putting

particles in in the initial state and

taking them out in the final state the

only end points would be allowed on the

top and the bottom okay so let's let's

take a particular term here Phi of X and

Phi of X Prime

these are neighboring points on the

lattice and they correspond to motion of

a particle from one place to another

there's a sum of terms that could be a

term for a particle from here to here a

term for a particle from here to here a

term for a particle from here to here

but none of these will contribute unless

of course there would be one situation

in which they would contribute that

would be of course if this layered

structure here was only two layers

hi and we put in a particle over here

and took one out at the neighboring

point then there would be a contribution

to the amplitude of that coming from

[Music]

this term in the product Phi of x times

five neighboring X that would contribute

and it would contribute to the amplitude

basically the fact the - I would tell

you that the amplitude to go from one

point to another was simply minus I this

coefficient here okay but that's not

very good if this how do we get from

here to here okay from here to here how

do we get a particle from here to here

and calculate the amplitude that if we

put in a particle over here that will

detect it over here for that we have to

find in this sum of products here we

have to have a term which will leave no

dangling ends okay let's take let's just

take this term here this has a particle

moving from X to X prime and then

another particle moving from X double

prime to X triple prime are you saying

the second term contributes only if only

only when the initial and final state

are adjacent this term here yeah yeah

that's right this notation means

neighboring particles neighboring

neighboring boxes here we have one

neighboring box and here we have two

other neighboring boxes yeah yeah yeah

it just means pick two neighboring

and some overall possibilities some this

is some overall neighboring pairs no no

no in general not but it can be in fact

this could even be the same pair but it

doesn't have to be some of all of them

alright so what does this one do it

moves a particle from X to X Prime and

this one moves a particle from X double

prime to X triple prime so one of them

moves a particle from here to here this

is X prime to X double at X from X to X

Prime and then the other one knows a

particle from here to here that's X

double Prime and X triple prime let's

say obviously there's going to be

dangling ins unless well let's uh let's

take this case here where we only have

three layers if we only have three

layers the only way to avoid dangling

ends is to have the first particle

connected to the second particle like

sorry the first box connected to the

neighboring box and then this box

connected to this box there won't be any

dangling ends except for the dangling

ends which correspond to the initial

particle and the final particles so if

this was only three layers thick we

would find the contribution here namely

where X prime is the same as X double

prime that transports the particle from

the initial position to the intermediate

position and then from the intermediate

position to the final position okay

what would be the amplitude then

associated with the particle going from

here to here at least conrick

corresponding to this term it would be a

1 over 2 factorial on a minus sign that

would be it you read off the

coefficients and the coefficients tell

you the the amplitude thus far we don't

have a way to get from here to here not

with two steps anyway two steps can

however if this was only two layers

thick we would have now a way to get

from here to here to go across the

diagonal how do we go across the

diagonal we go again to this second

order term here the term which has a two

factorial in it and we find the term

which takes us from X to X prime and

then from X prime from X to X Prime and

then from X prime to from here to here

and then here to here all right what's

that your other yeah there's another

path where you jump from here first to

here and then up I don't think there's

any other besides that yeah now it's at

all not with just two terms right okay

but now there was no reason to stop here

with only two terms let's go on we can

have three terms three terms would

correspond the going from one box to an

adjacent box well it would correspond to

the three distinct the steps and if

those three distinct steps with the

connected together into a chain in other

words in this sum of products we found

the term which took us and we could come

right back again that would contribute

together with the direct jump from here

to here would contribute to the

amplitude to go from this point to this

point

so you see built into this prescription

is something like the original particle

path integral idea the amplitude to get

from here to here is the sum over the

amplitude to go from here to here and

the amplitude to go through another

route also this one back here and

eventually if you expand this out the

arbitrary order there will be a term in

there for every possible route that you

can take the go from any initial

configuration to any final configuration

of that particle so first of all just

thinking about a single particle moving

in space-time this field Lagrangian

contains information about the

amplitudes the goal from now let's take

an arbitrary zero from any point to any

other point what you do is you add up

all of the possible ways of going there

and what is the coefficient for each way

of going there you read it off the

coefficient that multiplies that

particular term in this sum 1 over 2

factorial 1 over 3 factorial some of

them have eyes some of them don't have

eyes remember that I squared is minus 1

so some of them have eyes and some of

them don't have eyes and so in general

the the amplitude to go from one point

will be a complex number that's what's

new that's one of the things that's new

here that they can propagate up and down

and that's a feature of relativity

what's that uh-huh all right indeed yeah

yeah all right let's talk about going

backward in time

you could think our thoughts here's when

it goes backward in time you can think

of this as either allowing a new rule

where particles can go backward in time

or you can follow time forward and say

what really happened here is the

particle move from here to here and then

a particle pair particle/anti-particle

in fact were created the particle half

of it going to here and the anti

particle combining together with the

original particle to annihilate think of

it either way but the rule are now

allows trajectories which go backward

let's come back to this term here

this is conversing well the N factorial

certainly helped the convergence but

they're not enough to make it converge

yeah that's right

no no no no no no but the sum over

configurations doesn't have to converge

yeah this this part converges and it's

this is going to be some finite number

of total configurations considered okay

um let's we are now let's go on to a

slightly different problem we studied

the particle moving from one point to

another now let's suppose we put in two

particles and we want to know what the

probability for the two particles to go

to two other particles is in other words

we want to start and I'm going to take

the case where there are only two layers

for a moment there's the case with only

two layers per moment and I want to know

the probability that if I start a

particle over here it will get to here

no if I start two particles one over

here and one over here that they'll get

to here well come back to this term now

remember what this term did for me

before before it allowed me to hop three

units but that same term allows two

particles each to go one unit

look at it this can create a particle

this can annihilate it this can create a

different particle and annihilate it

this corresponds to a graph where you

start a particle in here and goes to

here that's this factor and the other

factor instead of taking the particle

that's already there and moving it over

here it just takes a totally new

particle and moves it

here so this same factor the same term

contributes both to the motion of a

single particle three boxes and it

contributes the two particles each

moving one box did I say that right more

or less three boxes one to the two boxes

yeah so there's a lot in here besides

just motion of a particle from one place

to another

it has information in it about any

number of starting particles going

through any other number of final

particles now in fact particle number

doesn't change as long as we just take

this into account

why not because every starting every

angle and point here well let's see

jóska in somewhere well if you start and

ends with different numbers of particles

then obviously something has to happen

well that would mean they have to do

this to be angling in some words

supposing I wanted to I mean I can't how

would you get from one particle to two

particles what if I start with

electron-positron I could end up with no

particles well okay that would be

something that would be something that

would just be something like this two

particles let's put another layer in

here yeah yes that that's true that

would correspond to an electron and a

positron for example annihilating each

other the only problem with it is

doesn't conserve energy so in fact when

you add it up all these amplitudes you

would get zero but but but um yeah but

yeah but under certain circumstances if

there was an electromagnetic field to

soak up the energy yes you're right it

would it would it would have information

in it about an electron positron

annihilating right so there's just a lot

in here there's a lot in here

um but not

everything not everything to find out

the other things that are implicit in

the field theory there are other terms

in the Lagrangian now what you put in

the Lagrangian is determined by

experiment so that's really just a way

of codifying the results of experiments

but what else can you have in Lagrangian

we had the derivative terms let's say

five squared minus the derivative of Phi

with respect to x squared + y squared +

Z squared all that kind of stuff that

was the stuff that I wrote down is Phi

at one point times Phi in another point

at a neighboring point then there are

possibly other things to just involve

Phi and not its derivative so for

example you could have things like Phi

squared remember what the coefficient is

usually a 1/2 here that's a convention

remember with the coefficient of Phi

squared is the square of the mass of the

particle the Violet we should divide by

2 that's again a convention and if we

included this term here what that would

do it doesn't move a particle from one

place to another it absorbs a particle

at one point and emits it from the same

point from the same point so we

correspond to the graphical

constructions where we would add a new

rule if a particle enters a region here

from one box to another one of the terms

that can act is this mass squared term

it would simply take the particle and do

nothing to it it would leave it in the

same spot then another term could come

and move it but it would weigh that

particular path with a factor of M

Squared every time this term act it

weighs the path with another factor of M

squared in the amplitude

so there would be terms where no m

squares act

we're only these derivative terms act in

other words we're an expanding this

product out we only have the derivative

terms that would be the theory of

massless particles the theory of massive

particles would have a new rule that one

of the possible things that can happen

at every step is you may only not just

weigh that path at that point with the M

Squared all right so the mass term is

another rule for how you evaluate these

paths these path integrals another rule

it's sir we we don't have to get into

detail the main point is that the mass

of a particle is codified by another

term in the Lagrangian which is M

Squared 5 squared which weighs paths in

such a way that it knows about their

mass all right but more interesting is

the more complicated terms things like v

square let's put a G sorry if I cubed Y

cubed can do a number of things it can

annihilate one particle and create two

particles it can annihilate two

particles and create one particle it can

create three particles it can annihilate

three particles all right so that's a

new kind of thing that can happen on

this checkerboard here in expanding out

the action expanding out the exponential

there might be additional terms here for

example G Phi cubed when we expand out

we can have not only these products

which take a particle from one point to

another but also processes where

particles are created and annihilated in

threes either 2 in 1 out 2 out 1 in or 3

in or 3 out what that looks like on here

is for example supposing we have

several of these quadratic terms which

move particles in one cubic term what

can that look like well what it can do

is it can take a particle moving it from

here here and suddenly in that box we

put a Phi Q in that box it can absorb

one particle and emit two more now the

next thing that could happen is the two

particles could move to other boxes but

basically what it does is it takes a

particle absorbs it and creates two and

those two particles can be on their way

and this would then contribute to a

process where one particle came in two

particles two went out in fact you can

make very very complicated things you

can make things of are but let's go back

to the one particle going from one place

to another one particle going from one

place to another

let me stop drawing checkerboards let's

just imagine the checkerboard there one

particle go one place to another can go

directly just a bunch of small hops a

bunch of these hops but also something

else can happen on the way at some point

the cubic term could act if the cubic

term can act it can take that one

particle coming in and split it split it

into two and then both particles move

along until another cubic term something

quadratic in the cubic term something

with two cubic terms in them can create

an extra particle and reabsorb it so in

fact the actual amplitude to go from one

point to another by one particle is not

just the sum of simple trajectories

going from one point

to another through the law through the

space-time but is more complicated it

has infinitely more complicated

it has processes where the particle

splits and rejoins in other words where

the particle emits a second particle

which is then reabsorbed an example of

this would be an electron moving along

and emitting a photon and reabsorbing it

part of the amplitude for an electron to

go from one place to another is through

the process of emission and absorption

of a photon it can get wildly more

complicated of course we have to add all

of these up the rule is add up the

amplitude for every possible way to go

from the initial state to the final

state you could have several of these

splitting and joinings you could have

things jumping across the gap between

particles and this can get arbitrarily

complicated from the point of view of

quanta of electrons and photons things

like this could happen

you know electron goes through photon

emitted another photon emitted but even

worse the photon can break up into an

electron and a positron

but then the electron and positron can

exchange a photon between them all of

these processes come out of expanding

out the action like this and finding the

individual terms which do all of these

things if you want the amplitude for any

one of these processes you just go back

to what appears here find the term that

you're looking for and find the

coefficient in front of it it may or may

not have an eye depending on whether

it's an even power an odd power and it

will have some factorials and so forth

that will give you the amplitude for a

specific process but then the full

amplitude to go from one thing to

another is the horrendously complicated

sümbül

right so you may have certain things

that happen in multiple of those

histories and one in multiple of those

histories you may have similar terms

which then the overall amplitude for

your data process would be actually from

all the different yeah from all the

different histories going from the

initial to the final so there are two

ways to think about field theory want us

to think about fields and think about

histories as initial values of the

fields final values of the fields and

you sum over all the values of the

fields in between and the other is this

particle way to think about it where the

field is replaced by a distribution of

quanta and again amplitudes for initial

configurations which means an initial

particular set of particles and a final

set of particles the basic processes the

basic underlying processes which happen

are governed by this Lagrangian that is

the most important thing anytime you

have more than two fields interacting

you have an interesting interaction

process where particles can split and

join and so forth what would happen if

you had five to the fourth here which is

a perfectly good interaction that would

be someplace where a particle for

example could come in and break up at

the three other particles now one to

absorb the initial state three to emit

the final state or it could be a

scattering in which two particles come

along collide and to go off anything

that looks like a vertex of four

particles all together to in and to out

or to in one to three in one out or so

forth or just four out or four in there

all governed by this term and so forth

and so on let's see how we're doing it

so that's the spontaneous arrival of

four particles at the final state yeah

except once again it would violate

energy conservation so if you really

worked it out and added up the amplitude

from every position where this could

happen every space-time position where

it could happen you would find out that

that doesn't happen doesn't happen in

other words they all add up to zero okay

so processes would violate energy

typically all add up to zero in these

things energy oh yeah knowing that we

did some examples I'll show you how

integrating the vertex overall time

conserves energy how integrating it over

all space conserves momentum same thing

is true here integrating the position of

these vertices and the endpoints of

these things over all possible positions

in space and time I will simply add up

to zero unless energy and momentum is

conserved but apart from the

conservation laws everything that that

you can draw down will happen with some

problem with some probability now how

could it possibly be that you add up

this four mungus thing and the answer

doesn't come out infinite well the

answer is that there are coefficients

here there are coefficients here these

are called coupling constants

particularly the coefficients for the

higher powers here we could call this G

3 we could call this G 4 and the rule is

in a diagram in a Fineman diagram like

this every time you have a vertex let's

say with 3 particles coming together the

amplitude contains a factor of

gg3 in this case so the more complicated

the diagram gets the more powers of G

that it has each vertex gives you a

power of G if G is a small number then

each successive power of G gives you a

smaller and smaller contribution and you

have a chance that the thing might be

able to converge the technical question

of whether it really converges or not is

a very difficult one but you can see

that you have a chance if G is a small

number if these coupling constants are

small numbers then the simple of the

process is in other words the fewer

number of vertices the bigger the

contribution and the larger the number

of vertices are more complicated the

smaller the contribution and you have a

chance at any rate at some sort of

convergence to an answer if the coupling

constants are large it means these

series do not converge and if they don't

converge it doesn't mean that the theory

is is wrong it just means you've chosen

a naive prescription for trying to work

with it but in practice most of the

quantum field theory most of the things

we do with quantum field theory are

based on the assumption of small

coupling constants and in those

circumstances it's possible to evaluate

these Fineman not just evaluate them but

add them up and find out that the one

with with four vertices is much smaller

than the one with two vertices so that's

the name of the game yeah yeah we're

going to talk about color theory

[Music]

now the next step is to name is to write

down the list of all particles and to

write down either in the form of

lagrangian's or in the form of Fineman

rules the farming rules and the

lagrangian's have the same information

in them three identical particles coming

together let's say three bosons that's 5

cubed particles going from one point to

another those are the kinetic terms the

quadratic terms here so the Fineman type

rules and the lagrangian are the same

thing and you can either describe the

world by specifying all the vertices

incidentally the lines between one point

and another are called propagators the

place where more than one particle more

than two particles come together those

are called vertices vertices and

propagators all right but there as I

said they're just simply another

shorthand way of describing a Lagrangian

the Lagrangian is a shorthand way of

describing the graphs so we would have

stated all of particle physics in a kind

of dumb way by simply writing them the

list of all particles writing or

constructing or even just expressing our

quantum field for each particle and then

writing down a Lagrangian for all those

particles would contain all of the

interactions or we can write down all of

the particles and simply specify what

all the possible vertices are either way

they come to the same thing they're kind

of a complete list of everything that

can happen once you know everything that

can happen you can start thinking about

calculating amplitudes for particles to

go from one place to another particles

to collide particles to collide and

scatter

here's particles colliding and scatter

two electrons colliding and scattering

just by a photon

jumping from one place to another all

right again Lagrangian tells you how to

calculate the amplitude for each of

these and as I said it contains all the

information including symmetries

including conservation laws so I think

it's probably so we write down the list

of all little hundred particles so when

you write down a finaland diagram

basically the bottom is the initial

configuration in the box that's right

that's right the bottom is the initial

configuration of particles the top is

the final configuration of particles and

as I said it is the kind of

complementary way to think about field

theory quantum field theory

complimentary to the field description

where you would start with a given field

configuration and endure the given Kidd

field configuration incidentally in some

R sense the complementarity between

particles and fields is very much like

the complementarity between momentum and

position these are two different ways to

describe the same reality and there are

uncertainty relations between them if

you know with precision the number of

particles then then you know that

there's uncertainty in the values of

fields if you know the values of fields

then there's uncertainty in number

particles so these are really two

complementary ways to describe the same

thing and the Lagrangian is useful in

both contexts

question and the couple of nonsense were

those predicted by or in their sometimes

under certain circumstances there are

symmetries which relate coupling

constants so this or that coupling

constant for this process might for

symmetry reasons be related to another

coupling constant for different process

process so some of them are related to

each other by the by symmetries but

their values in general are simply come

from experiment simply come from

experiment um all right much of this if

you really go and learn about quantum

field theory has its beauty it has that

it does have elegance and beauty and so

forth now when we start writing down the

list of facts what particles there are

what their masses are what their

coupling constants are it's just a mess

it's just a very ugly mess with very

little coherence except the coherence

that is really that that comes from

symmetries symmetries tell you

relationships between different kinds of

particles and their processes but apart

from the symmetries which are few and

not so much is a large number of random

facts about the about a somewhat

unmotivated collection of different

kinds of particles once you measure them

you measure them

oh absolutely no no I mean okay

well let's put it this way you have too

many particles which means too many

fields too many for any aesthetic

sense you have a lot of them a hundred

of them or something right a lot of

coupling constants which are just more

or less numbers pulled out of experiment

and a lot of masses which range all over

the map okay a few relationships between

them but once you know them once you

know them that's it you can calculate

with great precision anything about

those particles if anything about those

particles anything about quarks

electrons and photons and so forth means

atomic physics are these particle

physics it means atomic physics it means

nuclear physics it means a chemistry and

maybe it means biology maybe so so the

amount of input that goes in is perhaps

bigger than you might like but the

amount of that output is this huge

electron for example how big is it

gee Saban's could be g2 g3 g4

for how many GS are they were for

electrons and photons and

electrodynamics one the electric charge

the electric charge Villa hmm well in a

sense the electric charge is a kind of

g3 the electric charge is a kind of g3

the electric charge is the coefficient

in the amplitude representing an

electron coming in an electron going out

and a photon being emitted in terms of

symbols this diagram would be

represented by an electron going out an

electron coming in and the field

operator for a photon which is a I'm not

writing down the details there are some

poly I sorry some down some direct

matrices but then the numerical

coefficient in front of it is the

electric charge in certain units certain

dimensionless definition all right now

the only processes in quantum

electrodynamics are the emission and

absorption of photons from electrons

that's all there is

well if they're probably electron

collision with a yeah electron collision

with a photon is just the simplest

process would be photon absorbed

oh well protons are not usually

considered a part of the product quantum

electrodynamics now you can think that

you when you do quantum electrodynamics

you are doing atomic physics you think

of the proton as a point infinitely

massive you don't think of it as

something described by by quantum field

theory you just think of it as a nailed

down heavy particle which never moves

until you open up the theory of protons

and neutrons but all right so the

scattering by a photon a photon by an

electron this is the first time the

electron is moving at this almost the

speed of light relative to the proton

proton yes but we're right yeah that's

right let's joy let's draw some diagrams

just to get some feel for what kind of

things we have to add up this is the

lowest order diagram that goes into into

the scattering of a photon by an

electron there are two powers of the

electric charge so there's an e squared

but this is the amplitude the amplitude

gets squared to find the probability or

the cross section cross section is

another way of speaking about the

probability for the scattering all right

so that means that the whole process the

probability is proportional to the

electric charge to the fourth the

electric charge

at least in suitable with a suitable

definition is a small quantity the

square of the electric charge with again

with a suitable definition is about one

well that's the number which is 1 over

137 the fine-structure constant so this

is proportional to the square of the

fine-structure constant and so

scattering in quantum electrodynamics is

a unlikely

process a photon comes in and strikes an

electron what is the probability that it

goes right through it versus the

probability that it really scatters it

the probability that really scatters it

is governed by this e to the fourth and

it's a very small number now we have to

add all the processes that we can find

add them up to form a real amplitude and

simply there's another one here which

looks like this where the final photon

is emitted before the initial photon is

absorbed

that's another another process we have

to add them all but then we start any

more complicated things let's focus on

here and we can add another photon in

many ways this is not the only way we

could have to go from here to here from

here to here many photons but how many

powers of electric charge does this have

this has four powers of electric charge

in the amplitude and eighth in the

probability so this is even weaker but

then we can do even more complicated

things we can put a electron-positron

pair in here each time we complicate it

we add two more powers of electric

charge so in quantum electrodynamics the

expansion is typically an expansion and

powers of the square of the electric

charge every time you add another

complicating structure to a Fineman

diagram it's two powers of electric

charge and it means it's about a hundred

a couple of hundred times smaller in

amplitude than the previous one that's

why when you add them up it looks like

it converges because more and more

complicated they get the weaker the

probability from that particular

configuration incidentally you don't

square this and add it to the square of

this and add it to the square of this to

find the probability you add them up and

then you square

that's the rule add and then square and

and square that means it's cross terms

between them in calculating the

probabilities a coordinate of

interference terms so that's that's the

structure of quantum field theory that's

that's what we do with it

the next issue as I said well we're now

at the stage where we can really start

to sensibly talk about particle physics

we can name all the particles we can

specify their masses those are the

parameters in Lagrangian here that we've

spoken of and we can write down the

Lagrangian is governing them partly from

theory partly from experiment and

discuss their symmetries the symmetries

can be discussed by looking at the

Lagrangian we'll do that and we can

write down the standard model of

particle physics and discuss some of its

properties so I think we're off to I

think it was reset now to move ahead and

really discuss the world of genuine real

particles and what can be instead of

that M Squared is going to have two

hates it field and then that would be a

right right product we're going to

discuss that

oh they're here X and X prime could

stand for two different times that's how

we managed to move vertically there's

also some terms now there's this from

there are various terms where the

particles are stand still when we wrote

down Phi of X minus Phi of X prime

squared that hat did have terms in it

like Phi of x squared + 5 X prime

squared those are terms with the

particle stand still the cross terms are

the ones where it moves so there are

terms of the particle stand still both

from this and from Esther right okay
