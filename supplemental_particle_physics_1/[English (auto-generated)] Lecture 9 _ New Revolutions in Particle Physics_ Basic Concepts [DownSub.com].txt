Stanford University a very important

concept in particle physics are the

field equations of course the equations

of motion of the fields describing the

particles we've described boson fields

fermion fields are these electromagnetic

field all of these fields satisfy

equations the form of the equations is

more or less wave equations and it

involves derivatives of the field with

respect to space with respect to time

and the field itself and involves

derivatives of the field in the field

itself in other words the field

undifferentiated how do we code these

equations we just write down all of the

equations for all of the fields yeah we

could do that we could write down the

equation of motion for the

electromagnetic field for the electron

field for all of the fields in the

system and that would just be the

equations of motion but in our standard

classical mechanical systems field

theory even quantum field theory the

equations of motion always come from a

Lagrangian a Lagrangian is a very

important concept in classical mechanics

and quantum mechanics and in quantum

field theory Lagrangian is an object

that you do certain things to to

generate all of the equations of motion

of the system not just one by one the

equations of motion for each field but

it contains in one simple expression and

one condensed compact the expression all

of the equations of motion of a system

of fields or a system of degrees of

freedom in general the Lagrangian idea

in classical mechanics is very closely

related to the principle of least action

we're not going to go into that here I'm

going to just very quickly remind you of

the connection where what a Lagrangian

is what it depends on how you generate

the

equations of motion and do one or two

examples that's it that's all classical

physics and then explain to you what the

meaning of the Lagrangian is in quantum

mechanics the same lagrangian except

expressed not in terms of classical

fields but in terms of quantum fields

has a totally new meaning in terms of

quantum mechanics that dictates the

motion of particles the interaction

between particles cross sections for

collisions all sorts of things it

codifies it in very simple expression

one compact idea

okay so Lagrangian of a system of fields

let's call script L is a function I'll

write an L of for the simplicity let's

just imagine one field I'll tell you

what you do if you have more than one

field but supposing this one field Phi

the Lagrangian depends on the field and

it depends on the derivatives of the

field with respect to time and space so

it could depend on the derivative of

field with respect to time and the

derivatives of the field with respect to

XY and Z or more compactly it depends on

the field and the derivatives of the

field with respect to X mu this means

derivative with respect to X mu okay all

right now what do you do with the

Lagrangian to generate the field

equations I'm not going to prove this

we're not going to argue for these

equations we've done that in the past

several times I'm just going to tell you

what the rules are the rules are to

generate the equations of motion you

differentiate the Lagrangian with

respect to the derivatives of the field

for example derivative of L with respect

to

derivative of Phi with respect to T I'll

show you an example this looks abstract

at the moment then you differentiate

with respect to T you add to that the

derivative with respect to X of the

derivative of the Lagrangian with

respect to the gradient of the field

along the x axis same thing for y and z

and then you set that equal to the

derivative of the Lagrangian with

respect to the field itself Lagrangian

depends on the field itself that is the

equation of motion for the field Phi if

you're a grungy and depends on several

fields then you do the same thing over

and over for each one of the fields and

that generates the system of equations

are for all of the fields so as I said

we'll do an example as we go on we'll do

some examples but let's just do the very

simplest example just to see how this

works

a simple scalar field a very simple

scalar field simplest field as the

Lagrangian which is equal to the square

the derivative of Phi with respect to

time squared there's a conventional 1/2

in front of it derivative of Phi with

respect to x squared minus the same 1/2

derivative of Phi with respect to x

squared

same thing with y&z but I won't write it

out oh that's our minus sign here minus

sign and then finally minus some

function and we'll call it V of Phi or u

vo Phi that's the nature of the

Lagrangian of a simple scalar field

that's all there is to it no more than

that let's see if we can work out what

the field equations are ok you first

begin by differentiating the Lagrangian

with respect we could call this Phi dot

let's just call it five dot the

derivative of Phi with respect to time

and let's simplify the note that will

convince the notation instead of the

five divided by the X let's write Phi

sub X Phi sub X means the derivative of

Phi with respect to X

likewise for y&z yeah weird that will be

in here that will be in here okay right

okay so let's first differentiate the

Lagrangian with respect to Phi dot yes

Phi that right here Phi dot squared

one-half v dot squared the derivative

with respect to Phi dot is just Phi dot

itself differentiate one half v dot

squared with respect to Phi dot itself

differentiating the two cancels the one

half and you just get Phi dot but then

you have to differentiate again with

respect to time that makes a Phi double

dot two time derivatives second time

derivative then plus now the space

derivative terms come in with the

opposite sign from the time derivatives

I'll explain why in a moment but just

accept it they come in with the opposite

sign so you get exactly the same kind of

thing but with the opposite sign with

second space derivatives second

derivative of Phi with respect to x

squared

same thing with y&z and then on the

right hand side we have the derivative

of the Lagrangian with respect to Phi

the only place where Phi itself occurs

undifferentiated is in V of Phi so what

we get on the right hand side is minus

the derivative of V with respect to Phi

that's that's the form of a field

equation for a very very simple scalar

field um

some examples of vfi the simplest

example of vfi would be a constant but

then it would have no derivative with

respect to Phi and it wouldn't even

contribute here not interesting

we could have something linear in Phi

that's alright you can have something

linear in Phi but if this incidentally

is field energy via Phi is field energy

if V is unbounded from below means in

other words if V is just a linear

function of Phi that means the energy

the minimum of the energy is infinitely

far off negative infinity that that's

not good the first interesting example

is to perf I squared V a Phi is equal to

something proportional to Phi squared

alright a proportionality needs a

constant let's call the constant M

squared and let's put a 2 in there's no

content in that M squared over 2 is just

some constant I call it m squared over 2

because it has some physical meaning

that we'll see in a moment now what

happens if I differentiate

M squared over 2 Phi squared with

respect to Phi that gives me m squared

Phi differentiating V of Phi with

respect to Phi would just give me m

squared Phi all right so a again simple

wave equation Phi double dot minus

derivative of Phi with respect to x

squared after thought is equal to minus

I think M Squared Phi that is a very

very basic form for a wave equation both

in classical field theory quantum field

theory are electrodynamics all sorts of

situations this wave equation shows up

what does it say about the relationship

between the energy and momentum of a

quantum of the field far

let's move on to quantum mechanics now

in quantum field theory the energy is

related to the frequency differentiating

twice always gives us a factor of minus

two sorry minus Omega squared now if we

have a wave if we have a wave function

which is of the form e to the I Omega T

perhaps times e to the minus I K X I

think I want this way if I differentiate

with respect to time that brings down a

factor of I minus I Omega if I do it

twice it gives me a minus Omega squared

times Phi times Phi what happens if I

differentiate with respect to X twice

gives me two factors of K of K sub X all

right so this will give me plus K sub X

squared Phi plus case of Y squared plus

K sub Z squared all times Phi and on the

right hand side we have minus M Squared

Phi we can just cross off the Phi here

cancel it out and what this wave

equation tells us is just a relationship

between Omega and K squared it tells us

that Omega squared minus K squared is

equal to M Squared that's really the

whole content of the wave equation for a

wave moving down a particular axis it

tells us that Omega squared is equal

better yet Omega squared is equal to K

squared plus M Squared if we remember

let's work in our favorite units h-bar

equals C equals 1 sorry H bar H bar

equals C equals 1 then Omega is nothing

but the energy Omega is related to

energy by a factor of H bar this is

energy squared

equals momentum squared plus M squared

this is the usual relation if I wanted

to make it I want to put the speeds of

light back in and I would put let's see

I think a C squared over here and a C to

the fourth over here but in your

question but in units in which the speed

of light is equal to one this is just e

equals e squared equals P squared plus M

squared this is the usual relationship

between energy and momentum if we

interpret M as the mass of a single

quantum okay so what this equation tells

us then is really nothing but the

relationship between energy mass and

momentum with the stipulation that the

parameter m here is the mass of the

particle okay so that's quite the

elegant fact one other point in writing

lagrangian's it's important you want

your equations in the end to be

relativistically invariant invariant

under Lorentz transformations the only

thing you have to do to keep them

invariant under Lorentz transformations

is make sure that the Lagrangian is a

scalar if it's really a scalar and

transforms as a scalar and the Lorentz

transformation your equations of motion

will be invariant under Lorentz

transformation that's why this minus

sign is here remember whenever whenever

you're doing special relativity there

are minus signs in the relationship

between space and time if you like okay

so that's the basic setup for

lagrangian's and it's really quite

simple there could be several fields in

the Lagrangian and they could be

interacting with each other in some way

or another let me give you another

example of just one field supposing

instead of V of Phi being proportional

to Phi squared we also put in something

else for example I don't know G times

Phi Q

alright then there would be another term

in here where is it there would be

another term in here which would be I

guess - 3G Phi squared the equation of

motion would no longer be linear linear

means only contains first powers of

derivatives and the field itself if an

equation is linear it means you can add

solutions and get new solutions but now

we have a nonlinear term in the

equations of motion nonlinear means

quadratic and Phi quadratic cubic any

kind of higher power of Phi and so we

see a pattern the pattern is things in

the Lagrangian which are quadratic in

either derivatives or the field itself

lead to linear equations and things

which are higher powers than quadratic

lead to nonlinear equations nonlinear

equations mean solutions don't add first

let's take the case of linear equations

if we have linear equations and let's

suppose we have some wave moving down an

axis it's a solution and now we have

another wave superimposed well they're

not superimposed yet it's another wave

packet from the same field moving to the

left instead of the right and they pass

each other well if the equations of

motion are linear they will just go

right through each other that's the

nature of linear equations they'll just

go right through each other ah and the

solution will remain just after work

what this is is a certain solution what

this is is a certain solution and the

sum of the two solutions is just nothing

but the two wave packets coming at each

other for all time the solutions will

just remain the sums of the original two

solutions and all that will happen was

the pass right through each other and

come out the other end without

scattering without deforming and that's

it during the time that they pass

through each other there may be some

interference but then they'll pass

through each other and two wave packets

will

we'll separate separate undeformed on

the other hand if there are

nonlinearities in the equations of

motion that means the wave packets

scatter they influence each other and

they might not only scatter they might

break up they might do all kinds of

things much more complicated and that

creates scattering in particular

scattering of waves which to go off and

ran with directions whatever okay so

that's what nonlinearities higher powers

do here it causes the wave packets to be

nonlinear and to scatter another example

just to show you what you can do is you

might have two fields for simplicity two

scalar fields to make two scalar fields

we would take just these terms here and

write let's call it two fields Phi and

give me another world letter another

Greek letter Sigma Rho okay let's take

Phi in row

so another possibility for agrandi and

I'm not there's nothing special about

these I'm just writing down random

things 1/2 D mu Phi squared that's the

same thing I've written here

I just shortened it up and made it

simple that stands for v dot squared

minus the derivative of v with respect

to x squared and so forth just to give

it a shorthand we do the same thing what

do we call it Rho D mu Rho squared and

then we can add something which some V

some potential energy which depends on

both Phi and Rho okay so this could be

some fine Rho let's take an example it

could be an N squared Phi squared over 2

some other constant let's call it

capital N squared Rho squared over 2

minus

if that's all I had supposing that was

all I had

then the field equations would be

uncoupled separate field equations for

Phi and Rho doing this operation on Phi

we would get the Phi double dot minus

second derivative Phi with respect to x

squared data pot is equal to M squared

minus M Squared Phi and we get the same

kind of thing for Rho Rho double dot

minus the second row by DX squared of a

dot equals minus Big M Squared

Rho in other words we would just get two

separate independent wave equations with

two different parameters little M

squared and Big M squared and the two

parameters we correspond to the masses

of the two distinct fields or to the

quanta the masses of the quanta of the

two distinct fields this would be a

system of two kinds of particles Phi

quanta and Rho quanta with two different

masses in and Big M little m and big n

now we could add something more

complicated we could add for example

let's add Rho times Phi squared again

pick that random nothing special about

this when I work out the equation of

motion for Phi we have on the right hand

side the derivative of V with respect to

Phi what is the derivative of V with

respect to Phi well it's just equal to

minus here the derivative of V with

respect to Phi is just twice Rho Phi

right differentiating Phi squared this

gives me twice v on the other hand the

equation of motion for Rho we have to

put on the right-hand side minus the

derivative of V with respect to Rho and

that's just equal to minus Phi squared

okay so here we see an example of an

interaction

two fields a term in the Lagrangian

which involves both fields if a terminal

Lagrangian involves both fields in some

non-trivial way the result will be that

the wave equation alpha Phi will contain

Rho and the wave equation for Rho will

contain Phi if in addition this is not

quadratic then the equations are

nonlinear then nonlinear and coupled

that means that a wave packet of Phi

will scatter a wave packet of Rho and a

wave packet of Rho will scatter a wave

packet of five they'll come together and

do things and not just pass through each

other okay at this time is zero they'll

just pass through each other so somehow

these the terms in the Lagrangian like

Rho Phi squared are telling us something

about interaction between the quanta

it's telling us that the quanta of the

fields scatter each other that's what a

term like this is indicating okay these

terms here tell us about energy and

momentum this term tells us about mass

if we didn't have if we didn't have this

nonlinear term the content of this

equation would just be K squared Omega

squared equals K squared plus M Squared

that's all of these terms and this term

tells us about the interaction between

quanta that's classical physics that's

classical field theory in a nutshell let

me write down another example for you

another example is the Dirac equation or

looks first of all let's consider the

Dirac equation

what is the drag equation it has the

form I figure the eyes go re side dot is

equal to alpha derivative with respect

to X sigh I think there's an eye here

also anybody remember XO + M M beta sigh

beta was a matrix alpha was a collection

of three matrices this really means

alpha 1 D by DX 1 plus alpha 2 D by DX 2

and so forth that was the Dirac equation

can it be written in terms of Lagrangian

yes it can be written in terms of

Lagrangian the Lagrangian is just I

[Music]

think it's I side dagger derivative of

side with respect to T side dagger is

the complex conjugate of sigh R plus I

think it's plus that's not very

important side dagger alpha derivative

of side with respect to X and then

finally plus side dagger beta psy times

M you'll sometimes see this is the

Lagrangian this Lagrangian if you do the

same operations on it will give you the

Dirac equation that's the Lagrangian for

the Dirac equation we don't have to go

through it it's not important for us

right now I just want to indicate that

there is a Lagrangian

which generates the Dirac equation the

same way that the scalar field equation

was generated from the Lagrangian of the

scalar field

it's got Dirac matrices in it so it's a

little more complicated

it's a multi-component field but

nevertheless that the that direct field

is generated or the Dirac wave equation

is generated from this Lagrangian okay

this would just give you the ordinary

Dirac equation now supposing there was

another field in the problem possibly a

scalar field a scalar field a boson

field how my Q you would then add in

also the Lagrangian from the scalar

field in other words where is it the

scalar field Lagrangian maybe with just

the M Squared or maybe the MQ the 5

cubed term is that parentheses in the

right place I mean you have the I

overloading I don't remember maybe not

it's important not important not

important to us the important thing is

that we can couple the Dirac field to

the scalar field mean which essentially

means make the scatter the scalar field

scatter the Dirac field the Dirac field

scatter the scalar field by putting

terms of the Lagrangian which couple

them together for example something like

a side dagger now I'm writing something

that won't work side dagger times I and

will work but the it's not Lorentz

invariant side dagger times I times Phi

now this is not really quite legitimate

because it's not Lorentz invariant if

you wanted to make it Lorentz invariant

I'm not going to explain this tonight we

have to go back to some of the rack

matrix ology but you would just put in a

beta in here that would make it Lorentz

invariant the beta is just a matrix it

doesn't change the structure in the

appreciable way its product of to size

times a Phi and that would give you an

interesting field theory where five

fields scatter sy and sy fields scatter

Phi the whole thing is a big interacting

mess when flies come on size they

scatter each other yeah it's the same

beta it's the same beta right notice

side agus I times M and side agus I same

beta times Phi so it's almost as though

M was being replaced by a scalar

filled here ah this is the way Oh if you

took this Lagrangian it would generate

both the equations of motion for sy and

for Phi there would be a Dirac equation

with an extra term proportional to Phi

and a scalar field equation with an

extra term that would have sidebars I in

it so this is the pattern this is the

way quantum field theories are expressed

they're codified by writing down the

Lagrangian Lagrangian is the thing which

are which in a very simple way expresses

all of the content all the dynamics all

of the interactions between these fields

are those that's classical field theory

classical wave packet scattering of the

classical wave packets what about

quantum field theory all right so I'm

going to tell you very briefly what what

this has to do with interaction between

particles we've already talked at length

about the scattering of particles and

how it is represented for example by

products of fields fields are built up

out of creation and annihilation

operators so if you take a field for

example and I don't know let's take a

simple example Phi cubed what does that

represent when you think about it in

terms of creation and annihilation

operators Phi will contain both creation

operators let's call them a plusses plus

a minuses this is very schematic no

detail it will contain various creation

and annihilation operators and when it's

cubed it will contain all kinds of terms

terms which can absorb or annihilate

three particles that's the a the a-

cubed term terms which can create three

particles terms which can eat two

particles and spit out a third and so

forth

so five cubed has a meaning in terms of

particles coming in and particles going

out particle comes in two particles go

out at a point X that's what five cubed

of X represents from a quantum

mechanical point of view okay if I cubed

of X represents one particle coming in

and splitting into two at the point X

but there are many terms in adding up

five cubed of X the various terms

correspond to possible things which look

like this namely two particles coming in

one particle going out there's a

possibility of three particles going out

just produced at the the origin three

particles coming in what else oh I

missed anything I think that's it one

particle goes to two two particles go to

one no particles go to three and three

particles are disappear that's the kind

of thing which would be codified by Phi

cubed of X in fact the Lagrangian

represents that the sum of the terms

represent interactions like this the

other terms the quadratic terms the the

the higher powers here represent

interactions like this the quadratic

terms where of a Phi squared and here

these represent just the motion of a

particle on the motion of an undisturbed

particle so let's see how that works

let's take let's take a terminal ground

here's a term in the Lagrangian

derivative of Phi with respect to x

squared let me think of it the following

way the derivative of Phi is equal to

Phi at one point minus Phi at a

neighboring point let's call it

Prime that's what a derivative is right

a derivative is basically a difference

of the field of two neighboring points

and again schematically so squared

that's where Phi

derivative of Phi with respect to X

stands for this is put the one hats put

the one-half here alright this is one

half Phi of x squared plus one half Phi

of X prime squared but the important

point is the term which is a Phi of X

Phi of X prime these two terms are not

very interesting what do they do

they absorb a particle at a point and

produce another particle at exactly the

same point they might eat two particles

at the same point or they might take an

incoming particle a point X absorb it

and then just spit it back out at the

same point so they don't move the

particle around they just they're sort

of passive more or less passive this

term here absorbs a particle at X Prime

and re-emits it a point X or vice-versa

in other words what it does is it moves

a particle from point X to X Prime it

absorbs it if it finds it at X Prime and

then re-emits it at Point a at point X

so what is it then it's a if this is

point X and this is point X Prime it

just moves a particle from X to X Prime

that's the nature of these quadratic

terms of the Lagrangian they move

particles from one point to another if

you wanted to imagine the motion of a

particle from one point to a distant

point you might simply multiply these

terms in the Lagrangian together many

times so that the first time would move

the particle from X to X Prime next time

it will move it from X prime to X double

prime X prime to X triple prime and so

forth but stated simply the quadratic

terms in Lagrangian govern the motion of

the undisturbed particle that's what

they do they are connected with free

motion of a particle purple purple

purple on the other hand the nonlinear

terms the nonlinear terms being the

terms which are cubic for example and

you could have higher terms they could

be quartic they take particles and bring

them together and scatter them or

annihilate them and create new particles

so that's what the Lagrangian does as I

said it codifies these interactions

these are these processes in a very very

condensed way

[Music]

[Music]

yeah we do certainly we do we could call

the difference between the distance from

X to X Prime let's just call it distance

L and we put an L square downstairs so

right you do have to put a numerical

factor in there but the numerical factor

doesn't change anything it doesn't

change what these things do number is

just a number it still has the effect of

removing a particle at X Prime and

making it reappear at X or what is the

mass term do the mass term which is just

M Squared Phi squared also is sort of

like these terms here it's also

something which absorbs it emits a

particle at the same point you can

represent it let me represent it by

saying a particle comes in M squared

over 2 a particle comes in and a

particle goes out at the same point X in

comes in and goes out so this mass term

M Squared x squared it doesn't move the

particle around it just absorbs it and

re-emits it absorbs it or just it counts

particles really it just tells you

there's a particle there but strictly

speaking it absorbs a particle and

re-emits it from the same point that's

the that's the nature of the mass term

now we are of course drawing diagrams

and these diagrams are really nothing

but Fineman diagrams we're not going to

go into the depths of Fineman diagram

ology it's not that it's not important

to where we're going to go of course it

is important to really understanding

particle physics but let me just

illustrate one more little Feynman

diagram one more diagram describing a

particle process

this is an important one this is the

basic process of quantum electrodynamics

quantum electrodynamics described as

there's a description of electrons and

photons electrons and photons electrons

described by the Dirac field now first

of all the Dirac field for an electron

is composed out of creation of let's say

Phi is compare itself composed only out

of annihilation operators it's composed

out of annihilation operators so let's

write it as C R you see - but in the

expression for psy there's a sum over

all the possible momentum and all the

possible momenta and properties of the

electron in particular there are

annihilation operators for particles

with positive energy just write it this

way from and also annihilation operators

for particles of negative energy

remember the Dirac equation has

solutions with both positive energy and

negative energy and there are

annihilation operators inside for

positive energy and for negative energy

so dagger has creation operators see

plus also for positive energy and for

negative energy

that's just what the Dirac equation

approaches the Dirac field is creation

operators and annihilation operators now

we do a little switch this is the

annihilation operator for a particle for

an electron of negative energy it

removes a part it removes an electron of

negative energy absolutely equivalent to

removing a particle of negative energy

is putting in as adding a particle of

adding an anti particle of positive

energy the removal of a particle of

negative energy is the same as the

addition of an anti particle of positive

energy that's this filling the Dirac see

sort of thing and so forth and so this

operator over here the annihilation

operator for particle of negative energy

could be relabeled it can be relabeled

as a creation operator for an anti

particle of positive energy let's

indicate now that this is for an

electron and this is for a positron okay

so the rack field contains annihilation

operators for electrons and creation

operators for positrons likewise

side dagger contains creation operators

for electrons and annihilation operators

for positrons

there's just a switch of terminology a

switch of notation to represent the fact

that a positron is a hole in the

negative energy electron C okay so now

let's write down what the basic

interaction of quantum electrodynamics

is the basic interaction of quantum

electrodynamics are involves side dagger

sy and the photon field the photon field

is the electromagnetic field the vector

potential of the photon field if you

want to put things incorrectly the

vector potential is a is a vector so it

needs a vector index and then we have to

make a vector out of side agus I we do

that with the Dirac matrices and the

well let's say let's let's write it

correctly its side agus I times the time

component of the vector potential a

naught plus side dagger alpha sy times

the space components of the

electromagnetic field what is this thing

I call a the thing I call a is just a

field operator for photons right it's

just the field operator for photons

photons of course are particles which

have a directionality that they're

polarization they're polarization is a

little vector so photons have in

addition to a position and a momentum or

a momentum they have a little

orientation they carry a little flag

with them which points in a certain

direction it's their polarization and so

in other words they have a little bit of

a vector character to them and that's

what this vector is it's just a

polarization of the photon what does

this do this absorbs an electron let's

say it absorbs an electron

it can emit a positron let's say no

commit an electron see this one times

this one side dagger times I can absorb

an electron and then remit the electron

and at the same time emit a photon that

yeah that's a term in the Lagrangian

that's a term in the Lagrangian yeah it

is a scalar okay so let's let's go back

to the direct equation you can make

scalars by multiplying vectors together

who has me now you make scalars for

example by multiplying vectors together

right given two vectors B mu and mu you

can make a scalar like so yes yeah let's

let's now write we have a Mew but we

don't have a vector composed out of the

size but we do have a vector compose

that aside so let me tell you what the

vector composed out of the size is it's

just side a gas I is the time component

of it and side dagger alpha psy is the

is a space component of it that's it

all right so side dagger psy gets

multiplied by the time component and

side that alpha side gets multiplied by

the space component you add them

together okay right so that makes a

scalar

that makes scaler and look can we go

back to that other board for the one you

just cover it up by pulling this down

over here yeah

yeah okay thank you yeah now what does a

have in it a has creation and

annihilation operators for photons so

what we have here is products of

creation and creation upper yellow

mythic creation operators for electrons

and annihilation operators for positrons

that's here use annihilation operators

for electrons and creation operators for

positrons and here's creation and

annihilation operators for photons so it

describes a whole variety of different

kinds of processes let's draw some of

them a whole variety of different kinds

of processes in which electrons

positrons and so forth are created and

annihilated for example it can take an

incoming electron let's put a little

arrow on the electron to show to show

its direction of motion it can scatter

it and emit a photon what is that that's

an annihilation operator for an electron

a creation operator for the electron and

a creation operator for the photon

that's what this is all we can also have

electron comes in electron goes out

photon was absorbed by the electron so

here's emission of a photon is

absorption of a photon okay what else

can we have we can have let's label this

electron electron electron electron but

we can also have electron coming in and

positron coming in a - electron is a

negatively charged particle we'll call

it E - here we can have an electron

coming in and a positron coming in

that's usually drawn in this way an

electron coming in is drawn with an

arrow upward a positron coming in is

drawn with an arrow downward and then if

you draw it that way it looks as though

the electron just turns around but it's

not really it's not really what's going

on what's going on is electron

coming in and a positron is coming in

and a photon going off that's another

thing that's contained in this

combination when you multiply side

dagger times side times a more what else

are electron positron being produced by

a photon all these various processes are

contained in this one single expression

here side dagger side times a and they

all have the same coefficient in front

of them same numerical coefficient in

front of them and so all these processes

the probability for them the amplitude

for them the quantum mechanical

amplitude for them are all related to

each other simply by the fact that the

coefficient in front of them is the same

numerical value whatever it happens to

be what does it happen to be the

numerical coefficient in front of this I

didn't write it down we should write it

down

well it's leap no it's not the

fine-structure constant it's close it's

just the electric charge of the electron

yeah okay what is the electric charge of

electron the electric charge of a

particle is basically the amplitude it's

the square the square root of the

probability that an electron when it

scatters emits a photon electron every

point along its trajectory can emit a

photon the probability per unit time

along the trajectory for it to emit a

photon is the probability is the square

of the electric charge so electric

charge is the square root of the

probability it's the amplitude for the

for the photon to be emitted

yeah it's also the probability for a

scaling factor it's the probability per

unit there

[Music]

it's a dimensionless that's actually a

dimensionless quantity

it's a dimensionless quantity an example

of an example would be an electron bangs

into a wall and since stopped stopped

dead what's the probability that it

emits a photon what's the probability

that its energy or its momentum with its

energy goes off as an ally as a photon

question yeah so a electron of a given

energy plows into a wall is stopped dead

what's the probability that its momentum

continues in the form of a photon and

that's the electric this that's the

square of the electric charge so that's

the meaning of the electric charge in

quantum mechanics in classical field

theory it's just a coefficient in front

of the the interacting side and evil

okay yes

look the units for electric charge were

defined by people who well how much

current goes through a wire this sort of

thing that sort of thing in microscopic

quantum mechanics we usually define the

electric charge in a dimensionless way

we don't measure in terms of coulombs we

measure it just in terms of the charge

of an electron in units of the charge of

the electron so it's dimensionless but

really what it is it's the dimensionless

probability that a particle which

collides with a wall emits a photon and

it really is dimensionless the only

dimensions that you really need in

physics are mass length and time in fact

you don't need any dimensions you can

work in dimensionless units for

everything plunk units are called plunk

units are dimensionless and in plunk

units everything is dimensionless

including the electric charge is there

some use in grouping is this some using

grouping things of charge involved Ruby

yeah what is it good well I I mean it's

sometimes you'll write equations that

have several terms which you can then go

through the whole process and then pull

them out by equating left hand and right

hand side like terms on left hand left

hand all right

so it sort of has it is how many is that

simultaneously reserve any kind of delay

that comes out of the equation not no

not for these basic fundamental

processes not the process okay the these

operators are all evaluated at the same

space-time point all at the same

space-time point which means the

electron is absorbed re-emitted and the

photon is emitted from exactly the same

point is that what you're asking

yeah I guess what I was saying is you

have different kinds of conserved

quantities and they're individually

activated

oh yes that's true yeah the various

conserved quantities here would include

charge for example that has to be

conserved on in fact the conservation of

charge

there's nothing but the sort of

continuity of these arrows if we had a

process like this that would be what

would that be that would be an electron

coming in and a positron going out no

good then within a a negative charge

would turn into a positive charge so if

we represent the the flow of charge by

this arrow here then an electron moving

vertically upward time is upward of

course an electron would be represented

by an arrow going up a positron would be

represented by an arrow going down we do

not allow arrows to come together I

could have come together the rule is

always through going arrows arrows come

in and go out then go out come in and go

out and that is tantamount to the

conservation of charge the conservation

of charge is also ensured by the

[Music]

by the fact that we have one side and

one side dagger acai either creates an

electron or annihilates a positron that

means that I say that wrong acai

annihilates an electron acai and niall

AIT's an electron or creates a positron

in either case it increases the charge

by one unit when it annihilates electron

that increases the charge by one unit

when it creates a positron it increases

the charge by one unit side dagger does

the opposite so sine increases the

challenge by one unit side dagger

decreases the charge by one unit and so

whatever this term here governs in the

way of processes it concerns electric

charge to turn box use a Lagrangian in

the bottom right corner

in Judea well I haven't written the

whole thing there's also the terms like

this which govern the photon and the

Dirac equation these are the interaction

terms yeah those are the interaction

terms right I haven't bothered to write

the quadratic terms I don't think it's

technically accurate in my education

undergraduate pathogenic skeleton human

to LeBron gene with something you can

figure out from the scanning classic

physics and there's a right answer

leaves then a little bit when I think of

here you say and then what I read on the

side is it quantum mechanics Lagrangian

isn't something you can do something you

guess that you find a private experiment

whether you have a Medusa learn human

flexible mechanical system well actually

just look in the background but it is

something that was defined in my memory

was it as difference between them right

in fact here's kinetic energy of the

field

here's potential energy of the field

this are these spatial gradients are

kind of generalization of kinetic energy

kinetic energy means proportional to the

square of time derivatives potential

energy means not no derivatives so

that's exactly what it is kinetic energy

minus potential

and then exactly the same in yeah no

right it is the same in quantum

mechanics isn't that a miracle no it's

not a miracle the quantum mechanical

Lagrangian is much more fundamental in

the classical macadam mechanical you

start with a quantum mechanical system

described by some lagrangian and then in

the limit of large numbers of quanta

you'll work out its classical behavior

the remarkable property here is that if

this kind of Lagrangian here governs the

quantum mechanics then when you go to

the large number of quanta it will also

govern the classical wave equations

that's not obvious but it's true as far

as how physicists find out what

lagrangians are what the lagrangians of

systems are well of course sometimes

they guess them on the basis of deeper

theory and sometimes they get it right

and sometimes they don't get it right

but we know the lagrangian of quantum

electrodynamics with extreme precision

we know the lagrangian of the standard

model of particle physics with extreme

precision well how do we know it we know

it from experiment we know it by

colliding particles together and working

out just what kinds of basic

interactions it takes to describe those

those interactions between particles so

there's a little bit of an art there but

when you do collide particles together

and see what comes out you are looking

pretty directly at

question to find the diagrams if you

rotate them

ya know rotate from here to here hmm no

rotating means uh right yeah right I

think I left something out I left out

the possibility that an electron and a

positron can come together and a photon

also be absorbed at the same point so

you can think any one of these legs and

push them up push them down and it's

still a valid right quite remarkable I

mean that that one simple term can

describe all these different processes

[Music]

[Applause]

in question that one you just did that

that sort of citizens hopping together

to the positron and an electron and the

results enough all right

well of course yeah several lectures

back I showed you how energy

conservation is de Rivel by integrating

such processes over all time to remember

that when we integrated the amplitude

for such a process over time we found

energy conservation when we integrated

it over space

we found momentum conservation this is

the basic process if we took that

process and calculated the amplitude for

it and then integrated it over all the

places where the process could happen

that integration would ensure energy and

momentum would be conserved if energy

and momentum is conserved this kind of

thing can't really happen it can't

really happen because it would violate

the conservation of energy okay so we

have a little more work to do after

we've written down this diagram

expressed an amplitude for it we have to

integrate it over Everywhere's with

equal probability and that makes sure

that energy of momentum

[Music]

I'm not quite sure what you're saying

are you saying that when we integrate

over time excluded processes will

automatically go away yeah question

we're on the left side things like the

partial of time yeah

then over on the right side the deal is

expressed in my vision I like to operate

from here any take you the partial with

respect to time of occasion no you don't

take a puff okay good question remember

you don't take the derivative of the

creation operator the field looks like

sums or integrals of creation operators

or annihilation operators with things

like e to the ikx e to the minus I Omega

T right you're differentiating these

things not these things these things

don't depend on position yeah they're

like constants

they're like constants here's what

you're differentiating these objects

here that's why you pull down factors of

K and Omega by differentiating

let me give you another example x' of

interactions other kinds of processes

which exist in nature which can be

described by this kind of field theory

protons neutrons and mesons protons

neutrons and mesons form a system which

is fairly similar to quantum

electrodynamics so similar in the in

spirit protons are fermions neutrons are

fermions that describe by exactly the

same kind of fields as as electrons so

let's give them names

psy proton psy Neutron and then the

other objects in the theory are massan's

pie massan's are an interesting

collection of massan's what a PI meson

they are I will learn as we go on that

their quark antiquark pairs but we're

not interested in that now let's so

let's just think of them as particles

their scale of particles these are

direct particles and PI ons or scalar

particles they come in three varieties

pi plus pi minus m pi 0 what is the plus

minus and 0 the electric charge the

electric charge over pi plus is plus one

unit 1 unit in units of electron

electron charges

this one is negatively charged and this

one is electrically neutral the proton

is positively charged the neutron is

neutral okay so let me give you examples

of some interactions which do a color in

nature as side dagger proton that's a

side dagger proton sigh neutron let's

see now a sign neutron absorbs a neutron

and creates a proton let's play where we

have to put here a PI on

is it pi plus or PI minus let's say

let's try PI plus all right this absorbs

a positively charged PI meson and I

think I have it wrong

pi - it absorbs a negatively charged PI

meson pi minus emits a neutron and

absorbs a proton do I have that right

now a dolt absorbs a neutron and emits

approached and emits a proton and this

does not look possible because it looks

like a negative charge went to a

positive charge so I think I want 2 pi

plus here okay this is one interaction

which occurs in nuclear physics this is

one interaction which occurs between

mesons and nucleons nucleons or protons

and neutrons and it's described like

this this of course it's not a really

fundamental interaction the real thing

is quarks okay and we're going to break

this down into processes in terms of

quarks but if we didn't know about

quarks and when we didn't know about

quarks we represented protons and

neutrons in terms of fundamental fields

and prime essence in terms of

fundamental fields and we will write

down things like this what else can be

their side dagger Neutron side proton

and pi - this absorbs let's say this

absorbs a PI - and the proton and gives

off a neutron and side AG a proton side

proton PI 0 and also side dagger Neutron

sign Neutron and PI 0 alright what are

these things described they describe

proton goes to Neutron plus a PI plus

but of course the same vertex

yeah describes many processes it the

same one describes proton antineutron

antineutron antineutron represents by a

bar emitting a PI plus a whole variety

you can push the legs up and down when a

leg is switched you have to replace it

by an anti particle so if you take an

outgoing Neutron and take that outgoing

Neutron switch it around is proton

coming in it becomes an anti Neutron

coming in the outgoing Neutron when

switched around upside down becomes an

incoming antineutron so here's an

incoming proton incoming antineutron

they annihilate each other and create a

positively charged primers on so you can

work out or all the different

interactions that take place between

protons prions and neutrons and

basically all of them can happen as long

as they conserve charge as long as they

conserve charge they all happens they're

all part of nuclear physics all

possibilities and they're codified in a

small number of terms side dagger proton

sign Neutron pi plus and so forth so

that's another example of where the cell

where the sort of technology was

important in the early days before we

knew about quarks the fact that the

proton and neutron are made up out of

quarks well the size of the court

distribution is sort of like a atom like

electrons going around an atom and so

forth but it's much much smaller it's

much much smaller the proton and because

it's smaller it means at some level you

can think of it as a point particle in

other words for all measurements

interactions and so forth which don't

break it up

which don't break up the proton are you

can think of the proton it's pretty much

a point particle in that approximation

you pretend protons and neutrons are

described by fundamental fields of

course what what happened if you hit the

proton Neutron too hard is it'll break

up it will sort of break up into quarks

if it breaks up into quarks then you

won't get it you won't get away with the

description in which the proton and

neutron are prescribed by simple fields

you'll have to remember that it's made

of quarks all right

when proton and electron come together

okay okay yeah yeah there's of course

another vertex in involving protons and

the other vertex involving protons also

involves the photon here I just told you

about protons neutrons and pine massan's

but because protons are charged there's

another vertex which is proton photon

proton you can't have proton goes to

Neutron in the photon that doesn't

conserved charge so proton goes to

proton and a photon is another allowed

process and also electron goes to

electron in photon as an allowed process

so a possible process that can take

place when a when a proton encounters an

electron is the proton can emit the

photon and the electron absorb the

photon we haven't talked about building

up more complicated processes yet we're

going to talk about building up more

complicated processes but you can see

the pattern you can build processes of

these elementary units the elementary

units are these vertices and you build

up

[Music]

22 different space-time points told you

the Roger no that's not this this

process is not described it's the point

units that you start with that are

described by the Lagrangian okay this

corresponds to the product of the

Lagrangian to two different points okay

so the Lagrangian is some basic unit of

interaction which tells you that a

protons is absorbed and emitted at a

point and the photon that's the

interaction term that's side AG a proton

side proton and and a then there's the

quadratic terms which move the photon

along remember they were the things

which move the photon along from point

to point they can act many many times

moving the photon from one place to

another and then the photon can be

absorbed over here we're not we're

clearly not deriving all of this in any

sense from first principles I'm just

telling you that these basic elementary

processes out of which you build

everything are codified in the

Lagrangian and we're grunge Ian always

describes things which take place at a

point or perhaps a pair of neighboring

points two kinds of terms in Lagrangian

here's here they are this one here

describes a thing at a point something

comes in and something goes out from the

same point the other terms in Lagrangian

involves derivatives and they correspond

to things at very closeby neighboring

points motion of a particle from one

point to another no action at a distance

in in quantum field theory and worst

their or not at worst it's a good thing

but you can move a particle from one

point to a very very infinitesimally

close point or you can have processes

taking place at a specific individual

point there are no things in Lagrangian

which take a particle from one point and

put it at another point those processes

are built up

I built up out of more elementary

processes in this case something taking

place at this point something taking

place at this point and then a large

number of little processes moving the

electron run it only has terms at one of

those at one point one point or

parameter again we're going to riveters

that describes that proton electron

exchange not just has terms

there's no term in Lagrangian which

describes this whole process this

process is described by a large number

of basic units large number of basic

units is a process taking place at this

point

that's side daga protons I proton and

emission of a photon and then basic

elementary processes which move the

particle from one point to a neighboring

point to a neighboring point and then

the absorption of proton

but all of these are in the Lagrangian

in the right place each individual each

individual processes in the Lagrangian

but you have to compound them together

to make our a general process by

compounding multiple yes yes Lagrangian

can act any number of times at different

remember the Lagrangian itself is made

out of fields fields are made out of

creation and annihilation operators and

the Lagrangian can occur at each point

of space next point of space next point

in space and so forth and build up whole

processes so the Lagrangian is not

something which is a final answer it

describes the basic units and elements

that the compound themselves together

byproduct exactly as you said perform

[Music]

try to extend that to prosecutor taking

place over certain distances where under

conditions were behind this effective

facility okay there what can't you have

problems or are we just not seeing their

goal in the in case relativity are we're

on virtual dressing here if you if you

were if you're doing your compounding of

Rajan's and very close to the event

horizon of a black hole pool that would

spread the process well you really want

to talk about black holes what the devil

does not want describe a function is

good how hard can you how hard it is

ethnic distances well they have to think

about living so I said this idea time

hmm distant Empire I guess what kind of

thing

[Music]

the fields are symbols which are

operators they're operators which make

processes happen all right they're

processes the basic processes or basic

elementary processes they absorb a

particle or they emit a particle that's

all they do they absorb it take it in at

one point whether they take it in at one

point or spit it out from the same point

multiplying fields together can bring in

one particle and spit out another one

here let's put it this way a single

field by itself can absorb a particle or

spit out a particle the product of two

fields can absorb a particle and spit

out a particle you understand the

difference between r and n in one case

either the field a single power of the

field absorbs a particle or it emits a

particle two powers of the field absorb

and describe that

every yes it's just a cold it's just a

code right it's just a code for for the

elementary processes you have to compare

together well it does have time you get

adjust Wallas yeah stay screwed it is it

does okay so you think in terms of

space-time you think in terms of

space-time X and T E and you think of

the trajectory of a particle as being

built up or motion of a particle as

being built up as many little steps now

of course we have to pick limits we take

limits by by replacing derivatives of

the differences by derivatives and so

forth but let's think about little

differences rather than derivatives we

break up the trajectory into a lot of

little pieces and then a particle is

absorbed at this point readmitted at

this point so it's jumped from one point

to space-time to another point of

space-time and it's absorbed at this

point again and re-emitted it and

readmitted at this point in the process

it hops from point to point to point to

point now in the limit that we subdivide

this trajectory into an infinitely small

series of steps here the number of

processes goes to infinity all right so

there are limits involved but the

simplest way to think about it is to

subdivide everything into little pieces

and think of basic elementary units of

motion from one point to a neighboring

point it's an effective way to think

about it in fact quantum field theory

really always does have to be defined by

dividing up space-time into lots of

little cells that's the way you really

define it you break it up into lots of

little cells having broken it up into a

lot of little cells

[Music]

come on bringing that question so now

when you put all this together so you

can overlay these fields on top of each

other to describe cross to know that now

for any given point in time and space

what will happen at any

[Music]

a question that I originally asked was

now you combine them is described a

multi-step processes and we're asking

every year this is a multi-step process

as a commotion of describing products so

on the motion simply means annihilation

at one point creation and maybe not how

they move apart it is like really high

energies can there be are there bones

with like things like kinda

place in

[Music]

there's more and more existence all of

that is rather automatic if you if the

Lagrangian is a scalar

everything will be Lorentz invariant all

of that kind of thing about time

dilation and so forth will be automatic

you won't have to worry about it but I'm

not sure exactly what question you're

asking so I can't answer it

these operators who between creation

machinations of the arrow and the

classic American operators of position

momentum and in determining iceberg

[Music]

the connection between creation and

annihilation and Heisenberg uncertainty

alright

Heisenberg uncertainty is another way of

saying you either describe things in

terms of position or momentum up both

right the in terms of creation and

annihilation operators the creation

operators and annihilation operators are

either functions of position or

functions of momentum and the field

operator sigh of X is the creation

operator for a particle at point X it is

made up out of field operators let's

create a which are functions of momentum

times e to the R blah blah blah so a

creation operators are either creation

operators for a particle of momentum P

or creation operators for particle of

moment of position X but they are not

creation operators for particles of

position X and momentum P we never have

operators which create particles of

momentum P at position X either they're

functions of X or the functions of P and

the relationship between the functions

of X and the functions of P is simply

Fourier transform Fourier transform is

the essence of the uncertainty principle

and what it says is that the is that

build a function which is localized in

position you have to use a lot of

momenta to build a function which is

localized in momenta you aren't well

it's it's going to be spread over X but

this is just exactly the same thing as

it is an ordinary elementary quantum

mechanics you either have something

which is a function of X or a function

of P and nothing which is a function of

X and P that's all

you're describing how you've subdivided

the xt space sort of could you complete

that yeah could you just finish that

explanation yeah I mean it's okay at

some level it's no different than what

you're doing in classical physics in

classical physics how do you define

derivative you Devine derivative by

dividing up space into little cells and

then define differences that's what a

derivative is now in classical physics

you can really just take the limit

rather smoothly and forget the fact that

it originated from a very discreet

picture in quantum field theory it's

more problematic you really do have to

define the theory from the beginning by

dividing up space into little cells and

having divided into little cells in each

cell the field operator is now not a

function of continuous position it's now

a function of which one of these cells

you're in derivatives become differences

and the quadratic terms in the

Hamiltonian take a particle from one

cell remove it and put it into yes so

that's how you move this way so the

derivative respect to moving from place

to place yeah

find the theory by first dividing up

space placing your field operators one

or however many in each cell and then

the basic quadratic interactions will

absorb a particle from one cell and put

it into the neighboring cell then in the

end you take a limit where you take the

cells to be infinitely small okay so in

terms of a discrete picture a process

might absorb an electron over here the

electron which happened to have come

from a neighboring cell and so forth the

electron came from a neighboring cell

absorb it over here admit it over here

and emit a photon then the photon will

hop from cell to cell to cell by the

quadratic terms also the electrons will

hop from cell to cell the electron the

photon will hop from cell to cell to

cell where it might need an electron at

the so it's just basically two kinds of

things hopping from one point to another

and interactions which absorb some

particles and emit them from the same

point and then and and the mass term

here this M squared Phi squared it can

be thought of as a kind of interaction

where a particle comes into a cell and

is emitted from the same cell with a

coefficient M Squared

is there a relation between the size of

the cell and - customer no no the end

you want to shrink that size of the cell

to zero that are very precisely defined

the theory right now quantum field

theory is kind of a limit of a discrete

theory in which motion is replaced by

hopping and in which space is discrete

so the function of taking the product of

the Lagrangian is is basically it's a

probabilistic type of with your own

contingent probability that in order for

this process to go through you have to

have something going from here to there

to there yeah as opposed to it's not a

timing thing this it's over space-time

space-time

[Music]

probability projects in each cell each

so separate and then process goes up the

PS well processes pesto Abu sofyan

happens in space-time yeah I mean you

can few on the endoskeleton interesting

to think about what the initial state

such a system like this sort of thing

but that's that's the terminal type of

the experiment through the side seams

pair in laboratory just just

some some civilization

sure electron comes out very hostile

[Music]

at the position of the filament the

field operator operates which creates an

electron at the filament right so the

initial and final conditions the

absorbed the initial the initial

conditions are simply the start of the

the start of the particles coming in and

that happens that whatever the source of

the particles are the sources the the

final conditions are just described by

where the detectors are okay so and in

each case creation operators or field

operators located at the points of the

filaments which create the hot electrons

describe the emission of the electrons

from those points and the absorption of

the electrons that the detectors are

also described by field operators at the

positions of the detectives

to do field theory like it's not okay

if you're to develop your lot of space

time to just put the lagrangian's work

for the

the emitters where the emitters that's

right

that's right you describe that's right

you start you start the easy way to

think about is to start with the vacuum

now the initial state is not the vacuum

the initial state is some particles

present produced by the by the filaments

or whatever the source of the particles

are so those you represent by a bunch of

creation operators or field operators at

the position of the of the sources sigh

sigh sigh that's the initial state the

final States also a vacuum and then

annihilation operators I don't know side

daggers are dagger side dagger I guess

like that and then stuff takes place in

between these are just the initial and

final States but what goes on in between

is determined by this Lagrangian what

goes on in between is determined by the

Lagrangian so you might put in many

factors of the Lagrangian here all right

each factor of Lagrangian might absorb a

particle and emit a particle at a

neighboring point with enough powers of

Lagrangian here you can take all of the

particles and move them simultaneously

from one point to another so they absorb

the emission T the starting point would

be some particles which were produced

over here that would be this the final

things where the final States might be

particles absorbed over here come in

what happens in between is governed by

the dynamics which is justice Lagrangian

repeatedly acting and taking particles

from one point to another

creating annihilating particles and then

at the end

protectors of normal in principle

[Music]

are you in some sense integrating over

those integrating over positions of them

yeah yeah is that domestic degrading

those positions

I'm not trying to give you the finding

rules I'm not trying to explain exactly

how you use these things the main point

for us the main point for us is that the

interactions the basic interactions are

coded in simple expressions involving

field operators the reason we're going

there is because that makes it very easy

to think about symmetries for example

this term in the Lagrangian has a

symmetry what is that symmetry we talked

about it before the symmetry is the

symmetry of multiplying Tsai by e to the

I times theta where theta can be

anything side dagger at the same time

gets multiplied by e to the minus I

theta and side times side dagger will be

unaffected by this change of the

definite of either this change inside

side of table side DL so here's a

symmetry a symmetry of this Lagrangian

is multiplying side by a phase

multiplying side dagger by the complex

conjugate phase and doing nothing to AE

that will not change this Lagrangian

that becomes a symmetry what is that

symmetry associated with well it's just

associated with the statement that you

have equal number of size and side

baggers if you had different numbers of

size and side daggers this would not be

invariant all right what is the symmetry

that that has to do with equal number of

size and side daggers charge

conservation so the point is that the

the basic utility of this for us will be

to write down expressions where we can

read off the symmetries and from the

symmetries we do off the conservation

laws that's really what this is all

about the symmetries the conservation

laws and the very very basic primitive

processes which take place at each point

of space-time that's what the Lagrangian

contains in it what do you do with it

well you multiply it together many many

times which is just the same as saying

you repeat

basic processes in any order that's

allowed anything that can happen that's

allowed to happen by conservation laws

and all of that is described by taking

this Lagrangian and just hitting and

hitting and hitting and hitting so that

you take the initial state and

eventually evolve it into the final

state what is the output of this the

output of this is an amplitude but that

amplitude is governed by fineman's rules

which we're not going to take up now in

any case we probably will at some point

but for tonight all I really wanted to

do was to show to show you how basic

processes are coded by a Lagrangian and

[Music]

we will use that to see how symmetries

and conservation laws are connected with

each other

[Music]

sure sure I mean let's take the case of

the electromagnetic field the

eigenvalues of the electron electric

electric field or field operators in

general are the possible measurable

values of the field if you measure it

you do measure electromagnetic fields

there when you measure how do you

measure an electric field you measure an

electric field by putting a charge

particle into it and seeing how it

accelerates you can get different values

those values are the eigenvalues as we

like to see

[Music]

they're interesting Electric magnetic

field field operation general are built

up out of creation and annihilation

operators creation and annihilation

operators don't commute with each other

that means in general that the field

operators don't commute with each other

well what what's there not to commute

the fie has to commute with fie because

it's the same thing right

what's the commutator between the thing

in itself zero always all right so the

commutator of five with itself is always

zero but not so because you can take the

commutator of Phi at one point with Phi

at another point a neighboring or some

other point it could be a different

point there could be a neighboring point

each one of those Phi's is made out of

creation and annihilation operators

they're not the same operators because

they're evaluated at different positions

of space or time and in general they

will not commute what are the meaning of

this the meaning of this is that in

general you cannot simultaneously

measure the field operator with two

different positions

there are uncertainty relations in

measuring fields or time derivatives of

fields at two different positions of

space-time so you asked me about I think

you asked me about that did you ask me

about that yeah you asked me about the

field operator as a thing which which

can be measured well yes the field

operators can be measured there are

eigenvectors and eigenvalues play the

usual role as in quantum mechanics and

the commutation relations tell you

limitations on being able to measure two

things simultaneously so all the

standard rules of quantum mechanics

aspire to this system

we are gonna give you negative votes

most okay moment our volunteers yeah

electric unit measurement same thing

yeah it's a cool way to think about it I

mean you don't want to think about volts

and meters when you're thinking about if

you're better off measuring in terms of

number of photons and it's not

profitable to think of the

electromagnetic field when you're

thinking about microscopic physics and

ball and volts and meters

probably also not properly think about

the quantum field theory when you're

trying to water the house like summarize

today could you say that the idea of I'm

not saying is that the way to study all

these things basically by taking the

Rajee isms the building block and you

put them together in different ways and

this processes can happen over processes

can repeat one to the next the next the

lords or you can have a process followed

by a process followed by a process

followed by a process the basic all

processes are built up out of basic

elements and the basic elements have one

important feature that they are

associated with points of space or

neighboring points of space neighboring

points of space are pretty close

together so that's another way of saying

that they're local that nothing and

there's no action at a distance

that that the basic indivisible

processes are local and non-local

processes such as a photon going from

one place to another are built up at

when your creation of a photon right and

then it moves across space and you got

these Ling Rajan's that you think about

is there some simplification by

impacting many of them can you come up

with like a transformation that kind of

represents all of them right that you

can get from so basically you can break

it down to three processes the

generation the movement and the term the

creation the destruction roughly

speaking roughly speaking you simply

take this is not exact but it's roughly

speaking you take one plus let's call it

the the interaction Lagrangian L

interaction at point x

and now you multiply them together at

all points of space X 1 X 2 X 3 and X 4

and so forth what do you get then well

first of all you just get one that's not

interesting that doesn't do anything and

then you get all upon all the possible

terms in which every factor here is one

except one except one factor that will

give you the sum of the lagrangian over

all space ok let me show you what I mean

you take one plus the Lagrangian at

point X the same thing if point X Prime

1 plus Lagrangian at point X prime 1

plus the Lagrangian at point X double

Prime and you do this for every point in

space now every point in space means

every point on this grid let's take just

2 terms let's just take two factors what

does it give you it gives you 1 plus L

at point X plus L at point X prime plus

L at point x times L at point X prime

right all right what does this represent

this represents nothing happening this

represents a basic for example a basic

interaction at point X this represents

the same basic interaction taking place

at point X prime so this could be

nothing this could be particles absorbed

and emitted at point X this could be

particles absorbed and emitted at point

X Prime and what about this one

right so right this could be something

else happening over here and this one

would represent particle absorbed at

point x something emitted then

right given that first one happened then

the second one happened well the first

term he had just represents one process

and only one process pick the last

term's says that something is contingent

on something else about having well it

just means both things happen one after

the other time so represents two

particles being absorbed particle and

then two particles being you know you

see workman's and eventually by the time

you multiply all of these terms together

you get an infinite number of terms in

which a basic unit can happen at every

point of space once and then an infinite

number of terms where two points of

space are involved and then an infinite

number of terms where three points of

space are involved let's draw one with

three points of space are involved and

do particles come in a particle goes out

another particle goes out another

particle that's only two points of space

space-time and then another vertex over

here so that's two particles in three

particles hours I think what he is

saying is that if you have motion term

there also in here I'm just saying since

you since you have motion term one

motion term of movement from a photon

for a finite distance takes an infinite

number of applications of the Lagrangian

well that's true but

so I'm just saying that well you kind of

have equations of motion for that part

of the Lagrangian and you can just trace

out the motion or something motion of a

particle from here and here to here will

involve a bunch of terms this term will

appear this term will appear in this big

product some ways in this big product

there will be a term R which involves L

at point one point L at the neighboring

point L at the neighboring point L of

the neighboring point and which will

transport the particle from here to here

right so somewhere is in this big

product you'll find exactly the right

thing to take you from here to here

actually by many roots there will be

many okay first of all there will be

many many such terms which can take the

particle from here to here depending on

the orbit the actual amplitude to go

from here to here is the sum of them all

the possible ways you can get from here

to here by multiplying out this long

string of factors will give you a

possible possible process whereby the

particle can go from this point to this

point the total amplitude the thing that

you square to get the probability will

be the sum of all ways

inconsistent with the double slit

diffraction yeah exactly right so when

you multiply out this big string of

terms here you will find terms

corresponding to all possible routes

from here to here the amplitude will be

the sum of all those ways of getting

from here to here and when you square it

there will be interference terms in

particular if there are the whole sucks

one come from

Arthur Brooks there it's a trick to get

all the combinations yeah that's right

it's a trick it's a trick to get all the

combinations it really comes from

finding path integral methods but you

can just think of it as a trick to write

down all the combinations and that's

that's what really this is all about

just all possible combinations of ways

of going from one place to another or

described by this product here

I'm cheating a little bit when I write

this down is really a more technical

expression but this is close to the

right thing

who is that

well okay in quantum mechanics it's not

the principles

yeah the principle is station a reaction

good yeah that's right

the principle of no it's not the

principle of stationary action it's in

classical mechanics the principle of

stationary action picks out a particular

trajectory it picks out the trajectory

of let's say minimum action this is the

principle of summing over trajectories

where are where the amplitude for

summing over the trajectories is

determined by the action yes including

going on Paris from the way from my

office to my house it's an art form to

figure out what the what the Lagrangian

is once you know the Lagrangian the

rules are very definite so it does it

does it does but only like any other

mathematics has a torque you have to be

clever the what you would have we call

it when you don't know what you're doing

and you're groping and you're guessing

in the new art art yeah the the art form

is in finding tricks to figure out what

the Lagrangian is from experimental data

once you know it then you use it in a

very very precise formalism to calculate

probabilities

teacher says researchers call

yeah but you know somebody tells you

here is the Lagrangian here is the

process I'm interested in two particles

in four particles out the particles come

in from here four particles go out over

here calculate for me the probability

for that process to happen then quantum

field theory is extremely precise tool

there's no ambiguities and how you use

it it the ambiguities or not the

ambiguities but the art form is in

figuring out what that Lagrangian is

from experimental data

so the forms an artist gazillion

yeah big bond a bit the big book of

lagrangian's ah okay I think what you're

asking me is how complicated the

Lagrangian of the world is you know this

is what at least in physicists Minds

there is one Lagrangian that governs

everything now that may not really be

true but let's suppose that it is and it

contains a large number of fields it

contains all of the fields describing

all of the particles and all of the

interactions and it may have the sum of

many many terms like this describing

lots and lots of different interactions

but it's one Lagrangian may be composed

out of sums of pieces which individually

look like recognizable pieces but the

whole thing is one big Lagrangian that

governs all of nature and now this may

be really false but that's the idea that

there's one big Lagrangian with many

terms in it that just governs everything

you've got there one term oh well yeah

but maybe a little better than one term

at a time but roughly speaking yes every

time we discover a new particle we

discover a new field that has to go into

that Lagrangian every time we discover a

new process that's a new interaction in

Lagrangian so you might say well this

whole thing is a big giant mess and

indeed it is there probably at least a

hundred different elementary particles

things that we call elementary particles

500 different terms in the Lagrangian in

fact it's so bad that the kinds of

lagrangians that people write down to

describe the standard if you want to

write down all the physics which is

known which means quantum

electrodynamics the strong interaction

strong nuclear force quantum

chromodynamics the weak interactions of

gravity and everything else you

Lagrangian would feel not a book I don't

think but it would fill a couple of

couple of closely spaced Patriot pages

these fields what determined the shape

of the club yummy and well let's look at

the day you're going into you're going

beyond basic quantum field theory day

you're talking now about those things

which are outside the framework of

standard

the coupling persons are the

coefficients in the Lagrangian yeah so

for example here's a coupling constant

the mass the mass squared is also a kind

of coupling constant it's also a

coefficient in Lagrangian various

coefficients you can have five to the

fourth five to the six five to the 500

each one would be a coupling constant so

um it's a mess it's a big mess but once

you know the Lagrangian you know a lot

you deduce a lot of different kinds of

processes out of it now do you have to

know the whole thing in order for

example to study quantum electrodynamics

well if you wanted it with infinite

precision you would have to know how the

electron interacts with all the

particles all the different kinds of

particles through all of the possible

interactions but in fact um quarks are

not very important to the way electrons

behave quarks are pretty much isolated

from electrons they don't they don't mix

too much with them and so you can pretty

much ignore quarks if you're only

interested in electrons and photons at

atomic energies you just don't have

enough energy to sense the tiny tiny

quark structure and so for practical

purposes you can often break off a piece

of this Lagrangian and say all the other

things in it are not terribly important

to what you're calculating break off

small pieces of the Lagrangian and

calculate with it but in principle or if

you wanted infinitely precise things

about photons and electrons you would

just need the whole thing this is not a

pretty picture I mean this is this is

really not a pretty picture the it very

much makes you feel that quantum field

theory is some effective description

coming from like hydrodynamics or any

other effective description which is

coming from some more fundamental

physics and

uh just what's the right term

effectively describing things at some

coarse grain level that quantum quantum

field theory is probably just a

coarse-grained description of something

more fundamental and as long as that's

the case it can be very very complicated

although precise yeah

yeah I think that's my word right those

are the aggressed and on these crappy

are also what what's officially called

the standard model leaves are bad but

you can you know you can add gravity

into the standard model and talk about

the standard model with ground if the

Higgs

we don't need that we general when you

say relativistic times what

oh these LeBron James all relativistic

look at the Lagrangian in the standard

model we wouldn't see anything

general relativity this does not take

into account

general relativity special relativity it

does yeah this is bent this is the

combination of quantum mechanics and

special relativity if if all the

particles are massless except for the

terms involving any eggs basically you

have what just terms work which are bigs

interactions that that have like mass

terms for the other particles yeah okay

so I'll give you I think we talked about

this before but I'll tell you again so

we see that what the mass term is is

it's the coefficient of Phi squared

supposing we had another field that I'll

call H and supposing in the Lagrangian I

had you know let's try to write down

some terms H Phi squared now that's not

quadratic that's cubic so what does it

describe it describes a Phi in the Phi

out and an H being emitted okay that's

what this term doesn't Lagrangian now

imagine this more terms something like V

of H now V is potential energy the is

potential energy it's the potential

energy of the field H supposing V of H

happens to be a function which look so

let's say something like this here's H

and V of H is such that the minimum of

the potential is not at H equals 0 the

minimum of the potential energy defines

the stable equilibrium points the vacuum

is a stable equilibrium point so and for

this particular potential there might be

two minima and the real vacuum would be

chosen to be one of these two minima

this minima has a non zero value of H so

this vertex then become

just a it's not this vacuum value of H

here just becomes a number in the vacuum

and translates into the into the
