Stanford University all right so what is

particle physics about particle physics

is about particles it's about the

question and this is a very ancient

question at least I suspect about 2500

years old this nature discrete discrete

meaning to say not that it's polite but

that the that that matter and substances

and energy they didn't think about

energy but they thought about matter

that matter comes in discrete units in

indivisible units which of course the

Greeks called atom I am told that the

word atom means indivisible despite the

fact that of course we break up atoms

all the time nevertheless that was the

origin of the word indivisible that all

things in the universe are made up out

of something discrete let's call them

particles particles is a good name for

something discrete something indivisible

that idea is as I said extremely ancient

the opposite idea is also ancient again

I don't know precisely when it was first

formulated I happen to remember a little

more about the history of the atomic

idea that was this matter who it is

incidentally do not trust my history not

because I don't know the history but I

sometimes tell the history in which in

which I organize things logically rather

than rather than temporally so don't

trust the time sequence that I tell you

it often represents what I wish the time

sequence was rather than what it

actually was but it's good for being the

presenter logic of what happened to

presented in a logically compelling way

rather than a strict historical way in

any case are there were these characters

who were the Animus

and the the opposite of them the

people who thought that matter material

and so forth was continuously

distributed continuously distributed

means simply not made up out of discrete

elements but I don't know what the right

word is uniform continuous is the right

way right word a schmear as my

grandmother would have said a smear

smeared out of a space in some uniform

continuous kind of way and we might call

that the field theory of matter fields

what are fields fields are functions in

space for example they could be the

density of material are in in a given

region of space they could be the

electric and magnetic fields those are

good examples electric and magnetic

fields that determine how charged

particles move but the fields themselves

the electric and magnetic fields are

things that we conceive of as being

uniformly distributed in space not not

in the form of particles and so perhaps

matter liquids solids and so forth are

also in some sense continuous just like

the electromagnetic field that was the

opposite idea ah the particle idea that

the screen idea had words like molecules

atoms and so forth collisions and

particles the continuum idea continuum

is the right word the continuum idea had

words like Fields attached to it

continuous fields of properties of

various kinds which turned out to be

right in some sense neither and both in

some sense neither and both turned out

to be right the subtleties of quantum

mechanics got in the way of either of

them being completely right but it also

got in the way of either of them being

completely wrong

quantum mechanics is a subtle and

difficult subject ah as are many of the

preliminaries of particle physics

I think I have taught all of them by now

several times and they do exist on the

internet the internet lectures that I've

given they're out there and I advise you

as I said I will try to keep it

self-contained but I am going to assume

to some extent the knowledge that I have

taught previously in these classes it

can be picked up off the internet very

easily I don't know how to do it I

couldn't do it for the life of me I can

never access my own lectures but

everybody else can do it

and now the real reason is I don't like

looking at myself so I never I never do

open my own lectures but they're out

there and they're fairly complete there

are at least two courses out there on

quantum mechanics I think one on

classical mechanics at least one on

special theory of relativity and and

electromagnetism so since I put that

effort in I'm now going to try to draw

on it not today but in the future and

use many of the things that I have

lectured about okay as I said the

particle physics question is where the

nature is discrete or not let's just do

a little bit of history which I will

probably get wrong but the that's at

least chronologically to my knowledge

the first real evidence as again it's to

my knowledge the first real evidence

that matter was discrete came of course

from chemistry it didn't come from

physics it came from chemistry the

division between chemistry and physics

is a highly artificial one chemistry is

simply just the basically the physics of

atoms and molecules but it came from the

chemist or John John Dalton John I think

John Dalton who realized that the masses

of chemicals the mass of a given

number of molecules are given number of

molecules now how he knew that he was

how to deal with a given number of

molecules when he might be talking on

the one hand of hydrogen in other hand

of a carbon dioxide of something how he

knew it was a given number of molecules

is itself a story

Avogadro's name comes into it and so

forth the word mole not the creature

that lives under the ground but the the

mole is Avogadro's number of molecules

how they knew how many molecule they

didn't know how many molecules but how

they know how to compare different

substances and say both of them have the

same number of molecules that itself is

an interesting story but it's not the

story I want to tell the story I want to

tell how to do with the mass of a mole

of material a mass of a given number of

a god rose a number of molecules that it

came in discrete multiples of the mass

of a mole of hydrogen now not exactly

but close enough to a pretty good

precision R the mass of a mole of

gobbledygook is a integer multiple not

three not three halves not pi

not the not some other silly number but

some integer times the mass of the same

number of molecules of hydrogen that

sort of suggested the Dalton that they

were building blocks that carbon was a

carbon eight carbon twelve carbon twelve

had 12 units of whatever hydrogen one

had hydrogen was one unit of stuff

whatever that stuff was carbon twelve

and whatever whatever the other numbers

were so it seemed like things of being

built up out of basic units which

basically had the same mass as a

hydrogen atom almost as though

everything was made up out of units of

hydrogen Dalton I think proposed

something like that that they were base

units and those basic units had the mass

roughly of a hydrogen atom so that was

the first bit of evidence and of course

this was essentially right today we

understand let me just tell you why

that's true from today's perspective not

to make a mystery out of it everything

is made out of atoms and atoms are made

out of protons neutrons and electrons

electrons are very very light compared

to protons and neutrons and in counting

up the mass of an atom the electrons are

not very significant an electron has

about a mass of 1 mm no one yeah 1 mm 1

mm of the mass of a proton or a neutron

so electrons don't come into the

equation they do come into the equation

but only a very very small term forget

about them protons and neutrons

constitute most of the mass almost all

of the mass of ordinary material the

other hand protons and neutrons

surprisingly there's no there is a good

reason for it but but at the time there

was certainly no known reason in fact

protons and neutrons weren't known but

protons and neutrons have about the same

mass as each other as I said about 2,000

times the mass of an electron and so the

mass of a molecule is basically the mass

of protons plus neutrons they have about

the same mass and therefore the mass of

a molecule is an integer multiple of the

mass of a proton in Neutron on the other

hand hydrogen is the nucleus of hydrogen

is just one proton and so it did turn

out that Dalton was right all materials

have a mass which is approximately

there's an approximation in their

protons and neutrons don't have quite

the same mass slightly different less

than a percent incidentally a tenth of a

percent or even less ah whereas

electrons are so light that they don't

come into it very much and so Dalton was

right and it was the first to my

knowledge the first real evidence

that matter came in discrete units now

molecules weren't atoms of course took a

little while longer to find out that

molecules were made up out of atoms and

the atoms weren't just protons and

neutrons or hydrogen that atoms

themselves the things we now call atoms

that there were about a hundred of them

100 different kinds this was of course a

great triumph of chemistry of the 19th

century in early 20th century to

identify all of the elements that go

into the periodic table up there

incidentally the periodic table is not

very periodic at the you know if you

really look at it it it's it's a bit of

a fake the periodic table it's not very

periodic but nevertheless identifying

all those separate atoms up there the

elements the elements on some things

which are composed of all the same kind

you know that story they're composed of

atoms and identifying the atoms and at

the end of the identification of atoms

roughly about a hundred of them less

than 100 occurring in nature 92 of them

to be precise well more than that if you

include isotopes but order a hundred

different kinds of atoms and everything

made up out of atoms so atoms at the end

of the 19th century the things we call

atoms or elements were the building

blocks the elementary particles of

nature now of course it took another

five years after the turn of the century

for Einstein to do something that nailed

really really nailed the molecular

theory of matter

it wasn't until 1905 that Einstein

explained in detail how you could prove

that matter was really made out of

particles but the long before that

chemists physicists understood for the

most part that

that everything was made out of these 92

elements so they were the elementary

particles now sort of all hell broke

loose in the beginning of the 20th

century very very end of the 19th

century when some discoveries were made

the electron was discovered about three

years I think before the turn of the

century I don't I don't know exactly

when it was the electron was discovered

a number of other things were discovered

but in particular radioactivity was

discovered radioactivity was the first

real

signal of the thing which was later that

could become nuclear physics are and

nuclear physics and particle physics and

how only things that needed to be

explained sort of there in a sort of

tiny tiny little version so let me just

remind you about radioactivity just for

fun ah

who was it a discovered radioactivity I

don't even remember I know there was

Marie Curie who discovered radioactivity

and I think so hmm was a Becker Elle he

was Becker oh yeah

who's Marie Curie she what she did was

lots and lots of experiments to pin it

down with great but it was it was Becker

Ralph and he had a chunk of lead don't

ask me why he did this I do not know he

had a chunk of lead and a little hole in

the chunk of lead like that and some

material down here

radioactive is the first thing that

happened was he had some radioactive

material presumably radium or something

like it and his laboratory and he had a

photographic plate and accidentally the

photographic plate happened to be near

the are the material not here over here

material photographic plate and the

photographic plate got ruined but ruined

by the presence of the radioactive

material the radioactive material um

just ruined you know was like light

shining on it and ruined the

photographic plate anybody else or not

anybody else probably me would have just

thrown away the rather the the plate and

said that this is ruined let's find

another plate and start the experiment

over again but Becquerel realized he had

discovered something he had discovered

that radioactive materials do something

to the photographic plate as if they had

been illuminated by some radiation so he

decided to study that radiation a little

bit better and he put the source of it

deep in a block of lead how he knew to

use lead I do not know but lead was a

good substance because it's very dense

and he put it into a hole drilled into

the lead and then put his photographic

plate out here and wanted to see whether

it would illuminate a single spot over

here

everything was collimated by this hole

he wanted to see whether it would create

a sharp little spot as if something were

coming up out of this hole and indeed it

did so he got the idea that a beam of

some sort

was being ejected or something was being

ejected by this radioactive material and

being collimated along a beam that was

the first particle beam that was the

first beam of particles I what was it he

had no idea what it was but then I guess

a second for delicious accident I think

it was an accident again and I'm making

up the history as I go along but it's

close to the truth ah

he happened to have a magnet in a

laboratory and for some reason the

magnet was in a position here where a

magnetic field was created near where

these particles were being ejected and

what happened when he put the magnetic

field when he put the magnet near this

is the beam split into three separate

beams three separate beams one went

straight ahead just as if the magnetic

field was not there one of them

got deviated to the left and one of them

got deviated to the right left right

right left whatever one deviated more

than the other in fact there were not

symmetric and becker l or somebody

whoever was around knew enough to

realize that beams of particles

trajectories of particles get bent by

magnetic forces if you have a magnet and

you have a charged particle the charged

particle goes through the magnetic field

and either bends to the right or to the

left depending on the sign of the

magnetic field and the charge of the

particle so if the particle was a

positively charged particle it would

Bend one way in a magnetic field if it

was a negatively charged particle it

would Bend the other way in the magnetic

field and what Becquerel had found is

that there were three kinds of radiation

one behaving as if it was composed of

electrically neutral two particles which

one was electrically neutral the one

that wasn't deviated at all because he

didn't know they were particles only

knew is that some collimated effect

happened that illuminated the the the

detector of the screen the the

photographic plate one of them got

deviated to the right as if it were a

negatively charged particle he called

that component of the radiation he

called that component beta the component

that went straight ahead he called gamma

and the component that deviated in the

other direction as if it were positively

charged he called alpha these became the

three distinct kinds of radioactive

effects the three distinct kinds of

radioactivity beta radioactivity gamma

radial gamma and alpha just again I'm

not interested in making suspense here

let me just tell you what they were you

probably know what they were many most

of you well many of you know what they

were

beta was electrons negatively charged

particles which were just the electrons

that already had been previously

discovered from cathode ray tubes in

that kind of thing these are electrons

coming out the alpha particles we now

understand and at that time there was no

precedent for it that they are helium

nuclei two protons and two neutrons

stuck together

atomic number four Dalton would have had

he had he had access to helium which he

didn't he would have said helium was

number four on his on his integer

collection of materials and gamma are

photons okay electrically neutral no

electricity at all and these three kinds

right now um I think he did again III

don't remember the history but he might

have had a sufficiently dilute source

that these particles arrived one at a

time at their destination in that case

he would not have seen a bright spot

over here he would have seen blip-blip

blip-blip illumination occurring or

spots occurring discrete little spots

occurring for the electrons and he might

have said oh those are particles

particles arriving one at a time

illuminating a screen discreetly he

would have done exactly the same thing

for the alpha particles he would have

found that the alpha particles arrived

one at a time in other words he could

have used he might have you they

probably did use the screen here as a

counter analogous to a Geiger counter or

something whether he did or not I don't

know but but it's something you can

imagine that he detected the particles

coming one at a time that would

certainly be feasible with a Geiger

counter

and so evidence that whatever this

radiation is it's coming in discrete

little bundles that we could call

particles

what about gamma same thing for gamma

gamma is coming one at a time but at

that time becquer L had no idea neither

did anybody else

what gamma was it was uncharged that was

all that was known and it eliminated the

screen just as the others did okay that

was as I said in some sense the first

particle physics experiment we'll come

to some later particle physics

experiments soon enough let's next talk

about electromagnetic radiation ordinary

electromagnetic radiation oh well I said

I wasn't going to make suspense gamma is

photons gamma is light gamma well it's

very high-energy light but gamma is in

some way connected to ordinary light so

let's come to light gamma was the big

mystery because there were no neutral

particles known at that time that could

account for the gamma radiation so gamma

was a mystery and that mystery persisted

until fairly fairly late in the very

early Senate 20th century let's put it

that way

fairly late in the very early 20th

century was of course Planck and

Einstein really Einstein who were the

first to understood understand that

light comes in quanta that light comes

in photons but let's go back light was

sort of the strong strong case for

something which was not made of

particles light was something which was

clearly made of fields it was made of

the electromagnetic field

okay the electromagnetic field electric

fields and magnetic fields forming waves

when you shake a charge waves get given

off the wave field

our continuous-wave fields at least

according to classical electrodynamics

and they give off waves that propagate

through space completely continuously

and Newton of course had thought that

light was was particles but Newton by

that time had been completely relegated

to the dustbin at least as far as a

theory of light went there were many

experiments some of them done by Newton

himself that strongly said light is

waves not particles so let's just talk

about the light a little bit

electromagnetic radiation if you take

electromagnetic radiation it comes in

waves so if there's a source of

electromagnetic radiation here an

antenna some form of antenna emitting

could be radio waves it could be

microwaves it could be infrared it could

be light

it could be ultraviolet an atom is a

perfectly good antenna incidentally

doesn't have to be a big macroscopic a

tower an atom with the charge going

around in a circle is an antenna

antennas emit waves and those

electromagnetic waves when they also

fall on a photographic plate or other

device which is sensitive to light or

sensitive to radiation will illuminate

that illuminate that and turn it white

or black to the black I guess and that's

in the character of light now how do we

know that these things are waves how can

we tell that they're also not bullets

shot out of a shot out of the source

here so one thing you might do is still

very something very similar to what was

done over here put an obstruction a

little hole and see whether the light is

collimated exactly as if it were bullets

being shot out of a gun here those

bullets you would illuminate a little

spot over here now of course what

happened

is that you don't illuminate such a

small spot you eliminate something which

is fuzzier than that you only do the

funny of fuzzy region but that in itself

did not prove that light was waves not

at all

you could say well just maybe when these

particles go through this opening here

maybe they have little forces exerted on

them by the edges of the hole here or

whatever which deflect them some of them

get deflected and so maybe you get a

more smeary picture a more smearing

image than you might have hoped for so

it was not just that the beams got

deflected the light beams got deflected

that in itself was not enough to argue

for for a particle structure to light or

sorry a wave structure to light I'm

sorry but you do something else which is

much more sensitive to the wave

character light you here's the screen

over here again you open up two little

holes two little holes next to each

other if light was simply particles what

you would expect to find here is

basically two smears of the same kind

just superimposed on top of each other

maybe a little extra dense in the center

where they overlap but just two smears

one the image of this hole one the image

of that hole with nothing unusual this

of course is not what happens what

happens is each hole emits waves you

could do the same trick with water waves

in fact it's not hard to do the same

trick with water waves and the water

waves interfere if this is the high

point of a wave coming out of here and

this is the low point of a wave places

where the high points combine from the

two holes reinforce each other places

where a high point from one hole meets a

low point from the other hole cancel

each other and so the effect is to see

when it hits the screen here too

see bands the ends of positive

reinforcement where the high points add

missing places with no light where the

high points meet low points that's an

interference pattern an interference

pattern is a real signal of wave-like

motion of wave behavior waves up you can

do this as I said with water you just to

put your finger into water and wiggle

two fingers and two waves from the

tooling will spread out some places

they'll reinforce some places they'll

cancel and so rather peculiarly but not

nothing terribly unusual places which

were would have been illuminated by

either of the two holes by themselves

there's destructive interference they

get canceled and places you get

constructive interference and they add

and you get extra intensity that is the

kind of thing this interference property

was the kind of thing that really nailed

the wave theory of light

okay so light was a wave in fact this

did not occur after Newton it really

occurred before Newton Huygens Huygens

was a seventeenth seventeenth century

Huygens must have been 17th century but

previous to Newton who what yeah yeah

yeah yeah yeah but but Huygens already

had the basic ideas of wave propagation

and that's from the 1600s sometime so

this debate went back and Newton had

done many experiments himself which

should have been interpreted as

interference occurs interference wave

interference but he didn't in any case

after these experiments Young's

experiment others it was definitely

confirmed that light is made of waves

okay what kind of waves

well I took Maxwell Maxwell realized

that they were waves of electric and

magnetic field

you know what an electric and magnetic

field is an electric field well I look

it up if you don't know electric and

magnetic fields and light is a wavy

motion of electric and magnetic fields

first of all light is a wave and here's

a wave moving down the axis

what is that wave a wave in well it's a

wave of electric field here the electric

field is pointing down here the way

electric field is pointing up here the

electric field is pointing down let's

just go a line through there alternating

electric field up down up down and the

whole thing moves off with the speed of

light the whole thing moves off with the

speed of light electric field

incidentally there's also a magnetic

field attached to the thing it's a

complicated object it has magnetic field

also the magnetic field is perpendicular

to the electric field and so it sticks

out this way and that's what a light

wave would look like if you could see if

you could sample its electric and

magnetic field as it went past you of

course as it passes you it will

constantly alternate very rapidly if

it's if it's a ordinary light wave much

too rapidly for you to be able to see

but if it were an extremely long radio

wave very very long radio wave you might

be able to see the field oscillating in

front of you and this is this as I said

what it would look like it's a wave

being a wave it will exhibit

interference patterns and Maxwell had

absolutely nailed the wave and the

electromagnetic theory of light so let's

talk about waves a little bit before we

before we talk about particles let's

talk a little more on our waves and the

properties of waves the first property

of a wave that I want to

come-to is the wavelength wavelength is

simply the distance along the wave

before you return to before you return

one full cycle to the next wave all

right so you start here and you go and

you come back to the same exact kind of

thing as over here that's one cycle or

one full wavelength and the wavelength

the symbol for wavelength is lambda

Greek lambda lambda for length that's

the wavelength and it's measured in

units of distance it's measured in

meters or its measured in centimeters

whatever your choice of units are ah

okay so lambda equals wavelength

wavelength let's just call wavelength

another property is if you want to stand

still and just watch the wave go past

you you go ahead and go up and down and

up and down and up and down it would

have some frequency how many cycles per

second this is not the length of the

wave in space it's kind of the number of

cycles per second or perhaps even

something simpler the time that it takes

to go through one cycle as it passes you

that could we call the period of the

wave period it's a time it's measured in

seconds so Avera and a light wave has a

very very short period up and down up

and down extremely fast 10 to the minus

15 seconds or something whatever the

longer the wavelength the slow of the

period the shorter the wavelength the

faster the shorter the shorter the

wavelength is shorter the period

okay what's the connection between

wavelength and period yeah right so

think about the wave moving past you one

wavelength how long how far does it move

its move distance lambda how long has it

taken it's taken the period the distance

that it moves divided by the time that

it takes to move that distance is the

velocity of the wave

for light that would be the speed of

light if it's not a light wave it might

be moving with different speed it's a

water wave it would be much smaller

speed if it's a sound wave it's a

smaller speed but for a light wave the

wavelength divided by the period is

always equal to the speed of light

whatever the wavelength is the period is

given in terms of the wavelength of the

wavelength is given in terms of the

period so that's a fundamental relation

it's usually expressed a different way

the inverse of the period one over the

period is called the frequency it's the

number of waves it's the number of

oscillations per second the UH number of

oscillations per unit time is called the

frequency and that's equal to one over

the period faster the period the shorter

the frequency and so you can also write

this as the wavelength times the

frequency is equal to the speed of light

so if I give you the wavelength you can

tell me the frequency if I give you the

frequency you can tell me the wavelength

by solving this equation and that's the

fundamental connection between

wavelength and frequency now since one

of the things that I really do want to

teach you a little bit is the

terminology the physicists use for

things and they tend not to use the

terminology of cycles per second for

frequency they use something else

it's radians per second what does that

mean imagine a thing going around in a

circle it's going around in a circle

with a frequency F that means f times

around the circle per second

this is tend to use physicists and

mathematicians tend to use not the

number of times you go around in a

second

but the number of radians Radian is

about 57 degrees it's an angle about

that big how many radians per second and

the relationship between the frequency

in terms of cycles per second

and the frequency in terms of radians

per second is very simple in terms of

radians per second we call it Omega oh

man and their closely connected to each

other Omega is just two pi times the

frequency why two pi because there are

two pi radians in a circle so frequency

can be measured in either way physicists

tend to use Omega except when they're

writing elementary physics books for

undergraduate pre-med majors in which

case they use F okay we're all

physicists we're all grown up we're all

you know so we can use Omega like the

world of physics does Omega is the

frequency of light measured not in

cycles per second but in radians per

second you say where is the angle for a

light way of going but don't worry about

where the angle is just divide frequency

of its multiply frequency by two pi and

that defines Omega I proportional to

each other and so we can also write this

then as let's write it this way

frequency I'm going to write a frequency

is equal to C divided by lambda and now

I'm going to substitute for frequency

Omega divided by 2 pi and what do we get

we get Omega is equal to 2 pi C over

lambda fundamental equation of wave

motion that the frequency measured in

radians and the wave lengths are related

by 2 pi times the speed of light this of

course is true for any wave if you plug

in the right velocity okay we will use

that equation from time to time so get

it down now as I said light comes in

different wavelengths and those

different wavelengths characterize the

different kinds of radiation radio waves

or very long wavelengths meters or

certainly more than certainly more than

microscopic lengths radio waves can be

anything from what a few centimeters to

10 centimeters or something I don't

remember exactly where the radio

spectrum begins hmm okay go up to

anything our but rarely long wavelengths

are called still radio waves even though

no radio could work on the basis of

waves that had a wavelength of a billion

light years but still they still call

radio waves and where is the smaller

what's the smallest radio wave I think

about 10 centimeters I at small and it's

a highly arbitrary division of course

completely arbitrary

what's smaller than radio waves smaller

wavelength microwaves microwaves go from

a few centimeters down to the micron

micrometer or something like that micron

a smaller wavelength in microwaves

infrared infrared waves then from

infrared waves you have light waves

visible light visible light is a rather

narrow range of frequencies or

wavelengths and then comes a ultraviolet

shorter wavelengths x-rays gamma rays

gamma rays are just exactly these

objects here very very short wavelength

extremely short wavelength radiation and

that's what the Becquerel discovered

coming out of there now a trouble is

that Becker L discovered discrete bumps

you know discreet blips one at a time

and not nice continuous waves

okay that then brings us to the puzzle

of quantum mechanics now we're not going

to go into it in any great depth

certainly not tonight but let's just

recount the history a little bit

Einstein and Planck realized for a

variety of reasons mostly thermodynamic

properties of light that Einstein that

light had to be thought of as being made

up out of discrete indivisible elements

he might have it might have been an

experimental discovery in fact in some

sense becquerels discovery was an

experimental discovery it's just he

didn't realize the thing he was seeing

was electromagnetic radiation so I won't

go through the actual history but let's

make up a imaginary history of how the

discreteness of light might have been

discovered it could have been discovered

this way you again shine your light on a

you shine your light on the screen and

you illuminate the screen and of course

what you see is a nice continuous blob

of light it could either be an

interference pattern or it could just be

a single hole in which case it would

just be a blob on the screen but now you

do the experiment differently here's

your source of light you put an

obstruction in the way the obstructions

as a filter the obstruction is a not a

filter but a semi-transparent the semi

opaque thing which blocks out a certain

percentage of the light what happens

over here well blob gets dimmer okay

it's not as intense you make it thicker

it's even less intense you see less

light arriving per unit of time and you

make it even a little bit thicker and at

some point all of a sudden the character

of what's here changes and instead of

seeing the blob

you see discrete

events little blips now if you wait a

long time these little blips build up

and they build up to something which has

exactly the same pattern as the blob had

so the blob in this case then is some

sort of effect that has to do with lots

of little blips so many little blips

that you can't recognize them as being

individual that's the blob but if you

attenuate the light and cut it down so

that the intensity coming through here

is really really small

what you see is blips this experiment

can actually be done it was not done in

those early days but you can imagine and

this is what Einstein had suggested

really does happen in his photoelectric

paper that light comes through as

absolutely discrete things the

motivation for it was was thermodynamics

and other things but this might have

been the form of discovery discovering

these individual blips on the screen and

this is what really would happen so

something very very confusing going on

light is a wave that had already been

proved in fact if we put a screen over

here with two little holes in it two

little holes in it we will again see

light coming through bit by bit

one at a time and if we leave it up

there a long time the blips will sort of

fill in and what they will form is an

interference pattern so it became clear

that there are clear but still very

confusing that light is made up out of

indivisible elements called photons and

that the wave character of the light

really represents or the wave pattern

really represents the probability that

the photon appears at different places

in other words it's randomly arriving

blips but they arrive with a probability

in different locations which follows the

pattern that was established by the wave

theory the wave theory gives you a wave

theory of probabilities that's quantum

mechanics we may have to talk about we

will have to talk about quantum

mechanics a great deal more but this

kind of experiment this kind of

observation about light was the first

example of a connection which is really

in a sense what this course is all about

the connection first of all between

waves of any kind and particles they are

not two different things

somehow waves and particles are two

manifestations of the same thing we'll

have to come back to that and we'll try

to explain it perhaps again later now

I'm just filling in some early early

facts mostly just to set the stage waves

and particles at least when it came to

like well it was somehow intimately

connected and it didn't make sense to

say light as a particle or it didn't

make sense to say light as a wave but

has manifestations of both

all right the situation only got more

complicated when electrons was studied

electrons are clearly particles

everybody knows electrons are particles

there was no ambiguity about that no

more ambiguity than there was about

where the light was a wave or not it was

but yet something funny well something

funny also happened with electrons you

could do exactly the same kind of

experiment with electrons as you can

today this experiment can really be done

at the time it was a bit of a thought

experiment but equivalent experiments

you have to put the holes you have to

make a screen you put the holes much

closer to each other if you want to do

with electrons for one reason or another

and you send electrons through of course

they come through one at a time

everybody know electrons were little

particles that came through one at a

time but was totally unexpected is or

would have been unexpected was that the

electrons when you open two holes form

an interference pattern so it wasn't

just that light was funny particles were

funny in general our electrons exhibited

wave properties light exhibited particle

properties in fact had we taken the

alpha particles which are much heavier

than electrons much much heavier than

electrons 8,000 times heavier than an

electron much harder to do these kind of

experiments with but send them through

to little holes like that we also would

see interference patterns this has been

done with objects which are much much

bigger than helium nuclei namely bucky

balls bucky balls have been sent through

interference experiments like this and

seen to form the same kind of

interference pattern so everybody know

what a Bucky ball is 60 carbons 60

in shape of a generalized soccer ball

yeah right is it is it a rig is a

regular soccer ball got six yeah like a

soccer ball no it's not it's not really

a soccer ball but they're well so and

it's widely believed that if you did it

with bowling balls well you can't really

do it with bowling balls much much much

too hard I understand the people who did

it with buckyballs are going to try to

do it with living cells viruses the

prove that viruses are quantum

mechanical and then they're going to ask

the virus what the virus felt when it

anyway good the waves and particles are

somehow the same thing and if you want

to penetrate that more deeply you got to

learn some quantum mechanics and a place

to do it is in my lectures which don't

cost anything they're on the internet

okay

that's now let's talk about the

properties of photons a little bit

photons all these discrete indivisible

elements of light light has energy if

you absorb the sunlight it heats things

obviously has energy so therefore

photons have energy what do we know

about the energy of a photon photons

being indivisible we know the energy

must come in very discrete packets now

what is a photon characterized by or a

light wave imagine a light wave coming

in composed out of these discrete

photons don't try to picture it's

impossible to picture when the light

wave actually falls on a screen it forms

these little dots so it's particles made

of particles but we see some sort of

wave phenomena associated with it the

wave phenomena is associated with a

wavelength and therefore a frequency an

angular frequency we discover that that

light wave is made up out of discrete

units each with an indivisible bit of

energy cannot be subdivided and the

energy of one photon the energy of every

single photon in this light beam with a

given wavelength and a given frequency

is given by a number called h-bar plunks

constant one of plunks many kind one of

one of Planck's constant H bar times

Omega

in other words Omega is large when the

wavelength is short the shorter the

wavelength the larger the frequency

larger the frequency or the shorter the

wavelength the larger the energy in

every photon so first lesson short

wavelength photons have lots of energy

long wavelength individual photons have

very low energy now of course a radio

wave can carry a huge amount of energy

there's no question you can make radio

waves with lots and lots of energy

how do you make way radio waves with

lots of energy you pile lots of photons

up many many photons all with the same

wavelength and the same frequency but

there is something nevertheless some

remnant of the discreteness namely the

energy of such a wave is always an

integer multiple this is the energy of a

photon the energy of a light ray let's

just call it a ray or a light wave is

some integer number as an integer

multiple of h-bar Omega all right so the

light ray has come in indivisible units

every light ray

every light weight way every pulse of

light with a given frequency and wave

them wave wavelength

an integer multiple of energy in units

of h-bar Omega so this is an important

equation here this equation is of

absolute central importance to

understanding why particle physics is

the way it is in particular it's very

very central to the question of why we

have to build big giant machines to see

smaller and smaller objects my grandson

my grandson is not a kid he's 26 years

old but he asked me one day how come you

have to build bigger and bigger machines

to see smaller and smaller things why

don't you build small machines to see if

there are we're going to try to answer

that question but this is the central

fact that the energy is proportional to

the frequency of a photo of a given of a

single photon alright we've been through

waves and particles photons being

carrying discrete units of energy I want

to come to another set of concepts now

this is when I we're certainly not

abandoning this line of thought here but

there's another line of thought that I

want to remind you work mostly remind

you of not quantum mechanics but the

special theory of relativity special

theory of relativity plays a very

important role in particle physics

particle physics is in a sense

relativistic quantum mechanics the

combination of relativity and quantum

mechanics and so let me just remind you

of one particular simple fact and then

be clear about what that fact means most

famous equation of physics equals MC

squared this equation also plays a very

important role in the reason for in

explaining why particle physics is the

way it is

energy is MC squared let's just be very

clear about what it means armed in the

early days of relativity people spoke of

the rest mass of an object and the

moving mass of an object the moving mass

and the rest mass were different mass of

an object was minimum when it was

standing still but when it moved the

mass increases you still read that in

elementary physics textbooks but you

never read it in any in any work of

modern physics you never read that the

mass of an object depends on the state

of motion it's largely a change in

language the change in language is such

that what we now call mass is what used

to be called rest mass period whenever I

refer to a mass of an object I am

talking about its rest mass all

electrons have exactly the same rest

mass all electrons have exactly the same

mass period if you look up the masses of

particles in a in a you know in a table

of masses and so forth you will not find

them called rest mass you will just

qualify them called mass so from now on

we will never speak about the rest mass

we will speak about the mass of the

electron as a number that experimental

physicists measure in great detail every

electron has exactly the same mass as

every other electron and the mass is not

something which depends on the state of

motion but of course the energy is

something which depends on the state of

motion the faster an electron moves the

more kinetic energy it has so there's

something wrong with this equation yes

there's something wrong with this

equation this equation is no longer even

though it's the most famous equation in

physics it's not the right equation at

least with modern terminology energy is

only equal to

as times z-squared for an object at rest

the right way to say it is the energy of

an object at rest if the object has no

net motion now it could be a complicated

object with all sorts of internal

motions but it could be a box of gas all

the molecules flying around like mad but

as long as the box of gas is itself

stationary then we speak of its rest

mass and we can speak of its rest energy

the energy of that box of gas when it's

standing still and Einstein's equation

says that the rest energy of an object

is the rest mass or just the mass times

the speed of light squared now what

exactly let me imagine two experiments

that you might do to confirm this just

to understand precisely what it means

you take a pot oh not a pot a box with

molecules in it and you put it on a

scale to measure its weight or its mass

drum scale

the molecules are cold you begin with

the box of gas very very cold and you

measure the mass so you measure yes you

measure the mass you get some number

now you feed some energy into the box

you heat it up you heat up the molecules

in here you increase their energy the

box is still at rest the molecules are

not the molecules are moving around but

the box is at rest and we can ask what

is the rest mass of the box of gas the

answer is if you increase the energy by

adding thermal energy you add a certain

number of calories or a certain number

of joules joules unit of energy to the

box you will discover that the box is

mass the box of gas its mass increases

its weight increases okay now the amount

that it would increase is so tiny if you

increase the temperature by a thousand

degrees or something it's so tiny that

it would be quite unmeasurable but in

principle this is the meaning of e

equals mc-squared an object at rest if

you add energy to it its mass increases

its weight increases also its inertia

increases harder to move it another

example now this is the this example is

not something that you can really do but

the other example is something that

there's no real experimental physics

observational physics you start not you

start with electron and a positron we

haven't talked about anti particles

let's just ignore the fact that we

haven't talked about them for a moment

two kinds of particles electrons which

have negative charged positrons which

have positive charge they have exactly

the same mass precisely the same mass

they are in every respect similar except

for the fact that they have opposite

electric charge because they have

opposite electric charge they can

combine and disappear they have plus

charge and a minus charge the net charge

is zero nothing prevents them from this

peirong well something does the pepero

prevent them from disappearing they have

energy each one has an energy let's

suppose suppose these two particles are

at rest we bring them together each one

has an energy equal to MC squared so the

total energy is twice MC squared

well MC squared for each particle we

bring them together that energy can't

disappear energy is conserved what

happens to that energy that energy

becomes photons photons go out you bring

an electron next to a positron you let

them annihilate poof out go photons the

photons in some sense are energy they

can be absorbed by a material and heat

the material they can be converted to

all forms of energy and how much energy

do you get by annihilating an electron

and a positron

the answer is twice the mass of an

electron times the speed of light

squared it's a tiny amount of energy I

mean if you just had one electron and

positron you couldn't do much with it

you need you know huge numbers of them

to heat a cup of coffee but but still in

principle that's what happens and of

course this is this is an observational

fact that's the meaning of e equals MC

squared and another way to really say it

which i think is the right way to say it

is to say energy and mass at least for

an object at rest are the same thing why

do we have to have an equation really

it's just a conversion of units from

what we call mass units to what we call

energy units and this tells you the

conversion roughly like conversion from

meters to the centimeters or whatever

this is the conversion between energy

units and mass units all right but in

any case if you know the mass of an

object and you want to know how much

energy you would get if it disappeared

you multiply by the square of the speed

of light so you get a lot of energy for

a small amount of

yes what is the speed of light and what

is Planck's constant let's write down

the numerical values of the speed of

light and plugs constant we need them

one for here and one for here photon

energy

is the mass after the mechanism for the

energy to be released well does it help

yes it has to have a mechanism and we

haven't talked about that mechanism but

just let's let's stand on the outside

and say look this thing happens an

electron and a positron when you put

them together will just disappear let's

not ask what the mechanism is the one

thing we know is independent of the

mechanism energy should be conserved if

e equals mc-squared for the electrons

that energy has to show up somewheres so

there are some things you say without

knowing what the mechanism is

conservation laws where you know that

certain things are conserved you can

often say important things about a

system without knowing detailed

mechanisms okay let's talk about numbers

the speed of light is a very big number

Planck's constant is a very small number

how do I know it's a small number well

the energy of a photon is a tiny amount

of energy the frequency of a light wave

is very large so it better be that h-bar

is a small number try them down okay so

see the speed of light that is equal to

two point nine nine seven six two four

five eight I'm not kidding you this is

true plus of mine is something in the

last digit over here times ten to the

eighth meters per second units units are

important it's not just two point nine

nine seven six two four five eight times

ten to the eighth it's that number of

meters per second that's the speed of

light

how about Planck's constant then

everybody of course will memorize this

number because let's

important to this class that you know

that number one point same thing he'll

memorize this one one point oh five four

five five seven one six to eight times

ten to the minus 34 very small number

and what are the units anybody know what

the units are I worked out the units but

I think I erased them hmm

energy times time right well what are

the units of energy mass times velocity

squared right MC squared

that'll be MC squared mass times

velocity s kilograms times length

squared over x squared that's energy and

plunks constant has another unit of

length in it you know the unit of time

okay so Planck's constant is measured in

what's unit mass kilograms kilograms

meters squared divided by seconds so why

are these numbers so crazy why are they

so big why are they so small why are

they so odd I mean couldn't this nature

playing some awful joke on us to put

these that to make these numbers so

awkward or are people just being foolish

in using peculiar units for example the

speed of light is something which

depends on your choice of units if you

measure it instead of measuring it in

meters per second you measure it in feet

per hours you'll get a different answer

so there's nothing sacred about this

number it depends on the choice of units

length units in this case and time units

you could certainly work with units in

which the speed of light was a more

convenient number you could work with

units in which the speed of light was

one the units would be light years per

year for example the speed of light

one light year per year or one

light-second per second so it's not hard

to choose the speed of light to be one

you just use different units of space

and time same is true a Planck's

constant you can use units in which

Planck's constant is equal to one but

why is it that we actually use such

peculiar units why don't one how come

the people who invented units mister

metric or whoever he was the British are

worse than the metric system of cost

they were really perverse 5,280 feet in

a mile how many um how many stone how

many pounds on a stone sixteen I don't

know where they got these units from hmm

I don't know it's a stone sixteen pounds

again fourteen pounds even worse if

sixteen is at least divisible by two

four times but seven okay fourteen

fourteen pound

hmm that's another good one how about

horsepower yeah I mean just bizarre

units metric units are better but

they're also very very arbitrary

for example the meter had to do with how

far a man's hand is from his nose why

because it was using measuring lengths

of rope or something so these are highly

arbitrary units and have more to do with

biology than they have to do with

physics they have to do with biology in

the sense that the real question is not

why a meter is what it is why why a

meter is what it is it's a question of

why and why an arm has to have X number

of molecules in it and there's nothing

special about these numbers right given

that you can ask other units are there

better choices of units of the three

units what do we need we have we need

three units we need a length

the three things that need the three

kinds of units we need are length meters

or feet or whatever time seconds or

years or hours or something else and

mass all of the other units in physics

can be re-expressed in terms of ease

this is a complete set of units there

are three of them and we can choose them

in various ways for example instead of

using the kilogram we could use the mass

of a proton as the basic unit of mass or

the mass of the Sun or and so forth use

different units of mass um certain

things and astrophysics are a lot easier

not easier but a lot smaller the

equations are simpler they involve less

constants fewer constants if you use

units in which the mass of the Sun is

one okay equations in nuclear physics

are simply only simpler in the sense

that they don't involve as many

arbitrary constants if you use units in

which the mass of a proton is one so you

can make your equation simpler and get

rid of these weird numbers and how many

numbers can you get rid of how many

numbers can you get rid of this well you

have a choice of three units mass length

and time and that means you can simplify

three of the constants of nature or

three of the of these type of constants

here are and set them equal to one if

you like

so in astrophysics or in cosmology you

might want to use the light year that's

a much better unit than the centimeter

and if you use the light year and also

the year light year for distance here

for time speed of light comes out one of

course so we can simplify three

numbers usually and what are we to the

question of which numbers we simplify

might depend on what kind of physics

were doing if we're doing astrophysics

we might want to simplify certain

numbers if we're doing atomic physics we

might want to simplify other numbers and

in particle physics in particle physics

there are basically these two constants

which we can set equal to one by

appropriate choices of units appropriate

choices of units can set C equal to one

that's easy

you just use units in which time is

measured or in such a way that the time

and distance are measured in such a way

that the distance something moves in one

unit of time is one unit of distance

you can also set H bar equal to one you

have your choice about one other unit

what's a good unit to set equal to one

what's a good unit to a mass unit to set

equal to one in particle physics well

you could use it what about the proton

or another proton why not the Higgs

boson or not the why not the the MU

particle or well the answer is obvious

that there isn't the best there is no

particularly good unit of mass which

will simplify particle physics so that

the at best you can at best you can set

one arbitrary particle to have a mass of

one and that would be foolish because

there would be no particular reason to

focus on any one particle what about

that why do we pick the speed of light

and clunks constant as well they do

appear in so many equations but so does

the mass of the proton or the size of

the proton why okay I'll tell you why

are there are two very very fundamental

facts about plunks constant than the

speed of light and oh the way that I'll

say it is just to say the words no

object in nature moves faster than the

speed of light it doesn't matter what it

is no matter how you try to accelerate

it you can get it up closer and closer

to the speed of light but you can't pass

the speed of light all right for any

object in nature any right so there's

something Universal about the speed of

light it's a universal bound Universal

for all forms of matter that anything

that we can make it has a certain

universality all objects are constrained

by the speed of light so it has some it

has some reason to be thought of as

something universal what about Planck's

constant does Planck's constant come in

to anything where you would want to say

everything in the world necessarily has

precisely this property it's the

uncertainty principle we haven't

discussed the uncertainty principle but

all objects in nature the precision with

which you can measure their positions

and velocities and momenta are

constrained by exactly the same constant

the uncertainty in position times the

uncertainty in momentum

are always constrained to be as big or

bigger than Planck's constant again

everything all particles not just

particles but objects of all kind are

constrained by the same number so it's

for that reason the specialness of these

two constants that it makes a lot of

sense to set them equal to one the size

of the proton for example or not the

size of the program let's say the size

of the proton or the mass of the proton

there's nothing very special about the

proton the proton is one of hundreds of

elementary power elementary one of

hundreds of objects why didn't we set

the mass of give me some weird element

from up there rubidium why didn't we set

the mass of a rubidium atom to one

because you say rubidium is not in any

way more special than for polonium okay

you're learning about my chemistry

knowledge there's nothing special about

rubidium it's just one of many same

thing is true of the proton it's just

one of many the electron is one of many

so there's nothing Universal about it is

there a third universal quantity which

is so special that we might want to set

it equal to one something which

everything is constrained by yeah

trouble the electric charges a

dimensionless quantity but yes we could

do the electric charge is a fundamental

constant like that gravity right what

can we say we can say all objects in

nature attract each other with a force

which is equal to the product of the

mass divided by the square of the

distance between them times Newton's

constant we don't make any exceptions

it's not that there are some objects

which do that and other objects would

stomp incidentally in the case of the

electric charge of course there are

neutral particles so not all objects

interact in the same way electrically

but everything in the world interacts

exactly the same way product of the

masses divided by the square of the

distance between them times Newton's

constant so Newton's constant is one of

these very universal things G I don't

know what is it six point seven four

nine eight three one five four I assure

you it's not known to anything like that

kind of precision I think it's six point

seven times ten to the minus 11th and

some units or other it's another thing

that it makes a lot of sense to set

equal to one why don't we do it in

particle physics the reason is that

particle physics is totally insensitive

to gravity the gravitational force

between objects and particle physics is

absolutely negligible so gravity would

be a stupid

thing to set equal to one because

gravity just doesn't come into the

equations of particle physics particles

are too light to experience significant

amounts of gravity particles that we

know about today they're just too light

to experience any significant gravity

and so it there's no particular value

since none of the equations in particle

physics involved gee it better to leave

it alone just go away and not fix one of

the unit's just leave it free it even

better say that missing it what's that

is it fair to say that part just misses

it all the time because would be

insignificant you actually don't even

it's not even fair to assume that G is

dismissable that in fact examining is

may not be subject well of course we

know that they are subject to gravity if

you take enough particles they form the

earth then you take another enough

particle yeah so that's that's right we

don't really really know what how

elementary particles well no we do well

we can certainly take one elementary

particle and see how it behaves in the

field of the earth see whether it falls

and they do single particles do fall in

the field of the earth but how single

particles would influence each other

gravitationally that of course has never

been measured and so yeah it's it's

possible to question whether the

universal law of gravitation applies to

particles I don't think many physicists

do question it but the main point is a

point a practical point there's no

benefit gotten by setting G equal to one

in particle physics because G just

doesn't come into particle physics at

least uh in current versions of particle

physics

there are other

such as attraction to to electrons or

the other force wouldn't it make sense

bill are you thinking about

gravitational attraction to set those

two one with a set of G with attraction

is two electrons for example electrons

going to track they repel but the yeah

oh yeah you can't do that but that

doesn't go into your particle physics

either

it doesn't make you part of your visit

oh right it does it does yes you you

could use units and we often do in which

the electric charge is equal to one the

repulsion yeah is the third constant

yeah you could you could you could

you've heard traditionally we haven't

got traditionally we haven't there's a

reason that we haven't and I will

eventually get to it wasn't that to

fight about it like a charge the

dimensionless once you sets the bar to

be dimensionless the charge yeah the

charge the charge is equal to one over

100 square of the charge is equal to 1

over 137 is a dimensionless measure of

the charge and it's a completely

dimensionless number and we'll come to

it will come to what it means it you

could so you can set 1 over 137 there's

an obstruction to

because actually when I complete this

that's what they did then your third one

they said Kohl's constant Hui comes with

columns oh yeah you could for whatever

reason

historically we haven't done that and

there's probably no particular benefit

in it in any case we will use units in

which C and H bar are equal to one quite

often not always but sometimes only when

I want to illustrate the size of numbers

will I put C and H bar back into

equations so we owe some equations come

out to them simpler yeah if we set C

equal to 1 then e is equal to M that's

an energy in law and in energy and mass

which is the same thing we had another

equation over here e of a energy for a

photon this is the energy of a massive

particle which has some rest mass energy

of a photon is equal to H bar Omega now

the equation simplifies if we set H H

bar equal to 1 energy is just equal to

frequency so that that's just an

illustration of the use of what's that

no well yes yes yes yes yes but not for

a photon photons have no mass don't

forget this is okay there's a difference

between these two the meaning of e in

these equations in this equation its

rest mass and rest energy but photons

can never be brought to rest

nevertheless they do have energy but

it's not rest energy

it's the N it's basically kinetic energy

photons have kinetic energy energy of

motion so this is just plain energy

whatever the energy is and it's equal to

their frequency so they're two different

yeah well mass and rest mass rest energy

or so for this thing because what is

zero what is rest it has to be relative

to something yeah you know just just

forget the word rest now

let's forget the way rush you just

different use it to differentiate them

quick you know what is mass at rest in

the universe where would it be

not in the universe it's in the

laboratory we're talking about yeah

relative to the laboratory energies are

measured relative to the laboratory

energies are different depending on the

state of motion of the observer if you

have a photon or anything else and two

different observers observing it they

see two different energies obviously

even even in Newtonian physics that's

true if I have an object here and I see

it I say it has no kinetic energy you're

running by at 100 miles an hour you look

at it and you see that it has kinetic

energy so energy is something both sigh

young energy is something that depends

on the state of motion of an object it

makes sense to ask what the energy of

this cup of coffee is when it's at rest

then it's just the internal motion of

the molecules and so forth and no no

overall kinetic energy that's the thing

which is the M when you write energy is

equal to mass

on setting is the the counter that

sitting on is not address what's a key

in the universe accounted sitting on mat

it okay if it's it rest then its rest

relative to something else if on the

point is that energy is measured

relative to a given frame of reference

energy is not a universal thing that

everybody will agree on its relative to

a particular frame of reference so

relative to my frame of reference the

energy of this cup of coffee what it's

standing still relative to me is equal

to its mass okay maybe things constant

yeah didn't like frequency cycles per

second you said physicists use Omega 2

pi so much think that's a historical

factor my question is it seems to me -

pi nu 0:57

whatever 2 times that is more

complicated than a complete idea hmm I

really like why would one use something

that is be more complex than the single

person

good question engineering that yeah yeah

I mean there's some mathematical

simplicity to radians that the I I think

the answer is you look at all the

equations you write down you write them

in both in terms of frequencies and you

write them in terms of omegas and you

see in which form you'll encounter fewer

factors of 2 pi I'm not sure what the

answer to that is Omega

he related for sure practically speaking

is it possible to accelerate particles

fast enough with energy that they will

interact gravitational force will

certainly be very far from it

very very far from it no of course it

depends on what you mean by a particle I

don't think you'd want to call the earth

a particle but well what's elementary

yeah yeah but what this is also posted

on what it was a source of positron

where is the source of particle

high-energy collisions that's the only

way to do it you need it yeah you need a

you need a collision terror to create

positrons okay now look we apostasy

we used to hook leave the cage sometimes

your puzzle comes we use the planks cost

plank at time and plank distance and

things like that when we're not doing at

plumb time and plunk distance correspond

to setting G equal to one

yeah so we're not doing that now one of

the reasons that we might not want to do

that is once you set three of these

equal to one let's say then you have a

natural unit of length the natural unit

of time and natural unit of mass the

natural unit of length when you set G

equal to one and all of them equal to

one this called the Planck length and

it's very very much smaller than

anything that comes up in normal

particle physics so you would not want

to measure particle sizes particle radii

and so forth in units of the Planck man

a clock length it's just too small it's

much smaller than anything that occurs

in so that's the reason for not doing it

you use like in black holes or call them

all of years yeah anything that really

involves gravity and quantum mechanics

together and relativity it makes sense

to put all three of them to one but if

only two of them are important you may

only want to set two of the constants

equal to one okay let's see I want to go

a little bit further yeah let's go a

little bit further with the basic

concepts that will draw on over and over

I mean today I'm just listing basically

the preliminary concepts practically

establishing language energy mass

particles waves

Fields let's talk about another concept

that comes up over and over in particle

physics in fact it comes up over and

over and over cell physics momentum

momentum if you take an object and it's

at rest it has no momentum at all it may

have energy it has equals mc-squared

energy but it has no momentum an object

at rest if it's moving it typically has

momentum momentum is conserved just like

energy when two objects it could hit

each other the net amount of momentum

doesn't change and so momentum is a

conserved quantity and because it's a

conserved quantity it has an importance

anything that's conserved is important

momentum is a combination of the mass of

an object or better yet that's rest its

energy its energy and its direction of

motion its mass its velocity in its

direction of motion it's a vector

quantity it's a vector quantity and as a

rule it's proportional or as a vector

quantity it points along the direction

of motion of an object points along its

velocity for a non relativistic object

an object moving with much slower than

the speed of light the momentum of

course is equal to the mass times the

velocity the arrow on top means that

it's a vector quantity it has a

direction

okay so mass times velocity is momentum

in non relativistic physics but it's not

quite the right expression for in

relativistic physics and in particular

it's not quite the right thing for

things moving with the speed of light so

let's talk about light does light have

first of all does light have energy yes

a beam of light shining on something

heats it does light have momentum now

ordinary light if it hits you in the

chest or something doesn't give you much

of a push why it's because and the light

so dilute and it just doesn't have much

of a kick okay but if you got hit by

this laser beam that they make in where

is it in across the bay on the other

side what's that place um Livermore yeah

they got this great big laser and laser

shines it's light and when it hits a

piece of material it just implodes it

what is it that's imploding it it's the

momentum of the light just pure sheer

momentum and it can be huge

so yes light has momentum and a pulse of

light moving along let's imagine a pulse

of light moving along the x-axis every

pulse of light moving along a given

direction now of course real light might

have some dispersion it might some of it

might go out some parts of the light

wave may go one way some parts may call

it the other way but if the light is

very collimated so it's moving along a

particular axis then the right formula

now I'm not going to prove this I'm not

going to prove it I'm just going to tell

you the right formula for a light beam

is that it is the energy of the light

beam divided by the speed of light let

me just compare it with this or another

way to write it is the energy is C times

P but let's leave it in this form here

now let me just compare these two things

momentum is mass times velocity momentum

is energy divided by velocity just a

simple question are they dimensionally

the same other dimensionally same so to

inquire literally dimensionally the same

all you have to remember is that the

dimensions of energy am mass times the

speed of light squared so just in terms

of units energy is like MC squared

divided by C just tells you that the

momentum of a beam of light is its mass

times its velocity

not really it's mass its mass the rest

of the mass of the light beam is really

zero it has no mass rest mass but in

terms of units it's equal to an energy

times C squared

sorry mass times C squared divided by C

you get the point it's just a question

of units this doesn't look like this in

terms of units one has a velocity

upstairs one has a velocity downstairs

but it is the same in units when you

remember that e equals mc-squared okay

so this is the formula for the momentum

or the relationship between the momentum

and the energy of a light beam and it

points in the direction along this data

along the motion that's right that's

right how to write this let's just say

the magnitude of points along the

direction of the light beam but the

magnitude of the momentum is equal to

the energy divided by C the magnitude of

the momentum the direction is along the

direction of axis of the light beam

along the state of along the direction

of motion of the light beam but the

magnitude of the momentum the size of it

is equal to the energy of the light beam

divided by the speed of light C okay you

can see now momentum is energy divided

by C that's why that's why the momentum

is so small you can detect the energy of

a light beam sure you can it heats up

but heats up a little bit of water it

heats up it evaporates water and so far

it's not hard to detect the energy but

it's quite hard to detect the momentum

of the light beam and that's because

this is this C in the denominator here

momentum of a light beam is very small

typically cause if you as I said if you

pump up the light beam enough they can

give quite a kick all right so that

oh-oh let's let's do one little exercise

all right let's just um

yeah the momentum of a light beam is its

energy divided by the speed of light now

we have a formula remember the formula

for the energy of a photon let's take

one photon now one photon is an example

of a light beam let's figure out what

the momentum of a photon is so it is

equal to its energy divided by the speed

of light but what's the energy of a

photon h-bar Omega so the momentum in

magnitude is equal to H bar Omega

divided by the speed of light now do you

remember the relationship between

frequency wavelength and the speed of

light we had that before that yeah what

was it the freak frequency times

wavelength is equal to C right frequency

times wavelength and now for you if I

put Omega here Omega times lambda is

what 2 pi times C or 2 pi divided by C 2

pi times C right 2 pi times C no 2 pi C

over 2 pi C over 2 pi good C over 2 pi

is that right

we're makin is bigger than 4f Omega is

bigger than F right all right yeah right

so wait a minute I don't believe you I

don't believe you I got to do it myself

okay we have frequency times lambda

equals C right so therefore yeah so now

wait Omega is equal to 2pi times

frequency right so frequency is omega

over 2 pi so this is omega over 2 pi and

I say that Omega times lambda is 2 pi

times C I was right right

Omega times lambda is 2 pi C so let's

get rid of the Omega here and write

Omega is equal to 2 pi C over lambda

I've just divided by lambda let's just

see what we get we get momentum of a

photon is h-bar divided by C and now

times Omega and Omega is 2 PI over

lambda times C the C's cancel out that's

good because I know they C should cancel

out now what do we find we find the

momentum of a photon it's 2 pi H bar

that's a number divided by the

wavelength what what's that yeah yeah 2

pi H bar equals H right right we could

that's right right so right so P is also

equal to just old-fashioned H divided by

lambda there's an example where we did

it was possibly not so smart to use H

bar right okay look the two PI's are

gonna get you one way or another

someplace they're gonna get you the PI's

always come up somewhere you can't get

rid of them okay

what does this say this says the shorter

the wavelength the larger the momentum

of a photon Oh sing --gel photon of a

radio wave has a very very small

momentum a single photon of a gamma ray

a gamma ray is a very very short

wavelength photon as a good kick to it

one photon it won't hit the it's still a

pretty small kick but what this is

telling you is that the momentum is

related to the wavelength the shorter

the wavelength the bigger the momentum

that is extremely important lesson that

the shorter the wavelength the bigger

the momentum and also of course the

bigger the energy the energy and the

momentum are related or proportional to

each other so if you try to make very

short wavelength photons the result will

be that you have to spend a lot of

energy to make them now it becomes clear

why physicists have to build bigger and

bigger machines to see smaller and

smaller things the reason is if you want

to see a small thing you have to use

short wavelengths if you try to take a

picture of me with radio waves I would

look like a blur if you wanted to see

any sort of distinctness to my features

you would have to use wavelengths which

are shorter than the size of my head if

you wanted to see a little hair on my

head you will have to use wavelengths

which are as small as the thickness of

the hair on my head the smaller the

object that you want to see in a

microscope the shorter the wavelength of

light that you have to use okay if you

want to see an atom literally see what's

going on in an atom you'll have to

illuminate it with radiation whose

wavelength is as short as the size of

the atom but that means the short of the

wavelength the

all of the object you want to see the

larger the momentum of the photons that

you would have to use to see it so if

you want to see really small things you

have to use very make very high energy

particles very high energy photons or

very high energy particles of different

types how do you make high energy

particles you accelerate them in bigger

and bigger accelerators you have to pump

more and more energy into them to make

very high energy particles so this

equation and it's near relative what is

it's near relative e equals H bar Omega

these two equations are sort of the

central theme of particle physics that

particle physics progresses by making

higher and higher energy particles

because the higher and higher energy

particles have shorter and shorter

wavelengths that allow you to see

smaller and smaller structures that's

the pattern that has held sway over

basically a century of particle physics

or almost a century of particle physics

the striving for smaller and smaller

distances that's obviously what you want

to do you want to see smaller and

smaller things and at the same time the

striving for shorter and shorter

wavelengths which means the higher and

higher momentum or higher and higher

energy particles yeah we think there is

well yes and no yes in some sense yes we

think when you get down to the plunk

length something new begins to happen

and we can talk about that at some point

in these lectures where it may bottom

out but we're very far from the place

where it bottoms out if it bottoms out

it probably bottoms out at the plunk

length which is you know 17 orders of

magnitude smaller scale than what we're

trying to see at the LHC so we've got a

long ways to go a very long ways to go

even if it does bottom out

alright those are the basic facts that I

wanted to to get out in front of you

they sort of determine largely how

particle physics is progressed and as I

said it has progressed by going at every

stage the shorter and shorter

wavelengths larger and larger momentum

and energy and smaller and smaller

objects would there be any heuristic

saying that the wavelength or the size

of the particle you want to look at is

inversely related to the size of the

site left on your building realize it's

ridiculous ratio but is that sort of you

need one wrong speaker roughly speaking

yes that's correct

roughly speaking that's right um if you

have a given capacity to accelerate now

what determines your capacity to

accelerate the size of the electric and

the magnetic fields that you can create

so let's suppose you take the largest

fields that you can create then a magnet

made of steel this big and that

determines that determines your ability

to accelerate ability to accelerate

means the energy that you can pump into

something per meter even a meter of

accelerator how much energy can you pump

in all right so to double the amount of

energy that slack produces it would have

to be twice as long or round but there

that that's right but the round gives

you another problem the problem that

round gives you is that when particles

move in circular orbits they radiate and

when they radiate they lose energy so

let's take the case of a linear

accelerator the longer the linear

accelerator is the higher the energy

that you can pump the particles to and

pretty much linearly linearly

proportional to the size of the

accelerator and it's going to get

the double resolution yeah so basically

resolution time size is it costly or

rough yeah yeah so if you wanted to get

to this Planck length how big an

accelerator would you have to have well

as I said 17 orders of magnitude longer

than the CERN accelerator no no I think

it's more like the galaxies yeah I call

it the Gedanken I'm right higher I mean

the highest cosmic ray energy of 10 to

the 21 electron volts or something like

that which is a 21-9 is what quick 21

minus 9 12 10 to the 12 GeV whereas the

accelerator in well no it actually

doesn't work at the highest energy

cosmic rays a 10 to the 12 GeV but but

the problem is you see the problem is

cosmic rays they may have this huge

energy but they hit stationary targets

whereas in the accelerated CERN they're

going to be colliding targets and so you

get more bang for your buck from the

colliding particles but still still

cosmic rays have much more energy than

effective energy than the accelerators

the problem with them is in order to

really do good experiments you have to

have a few huge flux of particles you

can't do an experiment with one

high-energy particle it will probably

miss your target or it probably won't be

a good dead-on head-on collision learn

anything from that you learn very little

from that so what you want is enough

flux of particles so that so that you

have a good chance of having a

significant number of head-on collisions

that takes a lot of particles when the

targets are small

so I told you how big an accelerator you

would have to make now I would tell you

how many particles have to collide in

order to see something interesting and I

once worked out how much energy it would

take to fuel this accelerator in order

that you could do experiments and a

reasonable amount of time and then I got

something like a hundred trillion

barrels of oil a second so you need the

accelerator as big as the galaxy being

fueled by some time I think it was a

hundred trillion barrels of oil a second

and it's going to be a while till we do

experiments like that yeah but these are

but these are real distance scales I

mean they really do come in to physics

and the puzzle and the question is how

to probe them how to get at them without

being able to spend the hundred billion

barrels of oil and build a galactic

sized accelerator

so is it hopeful in what sense in what

sense would you ask your people compared

to this

it's not comfortable to the 10 to the 12

GeV from no when you have a particle

hitting a stationary target take that 10

to the 12 and take its square root

that's 10 to the 6th it's like having 10

to the sixth GeV in colliding particles

each one colliding so if you have two

particles colliding each one with 10 to

the sixth GeV it's like having one

particle with 10 to the 12 filling a

stationary particle now 10 to the 6

that's a million GeV that's a thousand

TeV so we're still very low compared to

what to what the cosmic rays can do but

if you have a handful of cosmic rays

coming in the chances are that it's

going to do an interesting collision or

negligible for more please visit us at
