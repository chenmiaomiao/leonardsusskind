Stanford University

this is Sanjay hey could we get Sanjay

on the aisle record recorded yes okay we

just want to know that we're trying to

collect up all the old lectures the

video lectures that are on YouTube in

one kind of a collection and the idea is

for everybody who's taking classes

online and offline we can actually have

an easy way to navigate through all the

lectures it should have to hunt for that

right so we're passing out a little

sheet that's got a web address on it

right now this is a temporary housing

for it and it should be good until

whenever us but it when we do get a

final home we'll have a link I'll

directly go to it as well

so this link should be good for

hopefully all eternity until we get

arrived in and all that good stuff all

right okay so this is the address let's

see HTTP colon slash slash new packet

Tech one word new packet tech top come

/resources slash and that's the address

where it's sort of the website for the

class so will be the website for the

class and it's for anybody outside

inside where they can easily access

without all a confusion that's taken

place up till now easily access all of

the lectures that are online all right

we we have been discussing a simple

quantum field and we're not finished

with it I have to take a two year course

and believe me a real course in quantum

field theory is genuinely two years of

work it really cannot be done in one

year sensibly I have to take that two

years of quantum field theory and

condense it down to a couple of lectures

we've already taken a couple of lectures

but I think we've had some forward

motion I want to take the very very

simple version of a quantum field that

we've already

discuss first of all to remind you what

it is and discuss how it is used again

the describe particle processes we've

done a bit of this we've talked a bit

about our the quantum field can code or

codify scattering processes or creation

and annihilation processes of particles

but I want to go into it in just a

little more depth so that you can see

where some of the really interesting

aspects of quantum field theory come

from and how they influence questions

like energy conservation momentum

conservation how do those things

how are they related to these quantum

fields that we've discussed ok before I

do so we need a little bit of

mathematics a little bit of formal

mathematics not much it's mathematics

that we've done before in these series

of classes but I want to get them up on

the blackboard the first thing is the

Dirac Delta function are the Dirac Delta

function just to remind you what it is

is a function which is the sort of a

limit of a genuine real function it's a

function of let's say its coordinate

let's for the moment this call is

coordinate anything it could be X it

could be K let's just call it Y so that

we don't prejudice whether it's

something that I've called the that I've

defined previously the Dirac Delta

function is a function which is a sort

of lump it's concentrated someplace

that's concentrated someplace and not

other places but it's the limit of an

infinitely sharply are concentrated

function so we imagine that we can go to

a limit where this lump like function is

infinitely narrow now I can't draw

infinitely narrow so I'll draw with

finite width but imagine in your mind

narrowing it narrowing and narrowing it

now of course if you narrow it without

raising its height the area under it

will decrease in decrease in decrease to

the point where there's no area left

under it so what I want to do is to keep

the area under this function fixed as I

decrease the width so as I decrease the

width I'm going to raise up the height

of it in such a way that the product of

height times width stays constant how

constant one just one an area of one

located someplace infinitely narrow

that's called a Dirac Delta function if

this point is y equals let's call it a

just R to locate the particular point

then the Dirac Delta function is Delta

of y minus a and Delta of y minus a is

zero whenever Y does not equal a over

here over here and equal something

infinitely sharply peaked at y equals a

that's the Dirac Delta function and it

has the property by definition that the

area under it the derivative the

integral with respect to Y is 1 so it's

so narrow and so high that the area is 1

and it's concentrated at the point where

the argument of the function is equal to

0 in other words when y equals a that's

the direct Delta function ok now I want

to show you how the Dirac Delta function

emerges from a certain integral an

integral that we will come on many many

times let's take the function e to the I

KX K oops e to the I K

X now again as we discussed last time

with discussing this on an interval

which is a periodic interval which has

total length all around it equal to L so

the distance around here is equal to L I

don't know if this just a distance

around that is equal to L that's

periodic and so functions that live on

this periodic space here should be

periodic meaning to say they should come

back to themselves after one full loop

okay now what is K first of all K is one

of the allowed values of wave number on

this in other words one of the values of

K where e to the ikx is periodic so

let's assume an allowed value there and

let's take this function and integrate

it over the entire cyclic X dimension

here we could take X going from 0 to L

or for symmetry I could take it to go

from minus L over 2 to L over 2 in other

words instead of starting X at 0 and

going to L I could start it at minus L

over 2 and go to L over 2 put 0 at the

center here nothing special about this

it just Scimitar eise's things learn

nicely so that the negative 1/2 and the

positive herefor symmetric when you

leave the space if you're marching along

and you come to L over 2 you pop back up

at minus L over 2 ok so we're taking a

function a periodic function e to the

ikx and integrating it from minus L over

2 to L over 2 what is the answer ok

first of all what does the answer if K

is equal to 0

L

this is El what's right is equal to L if

K is equal to zero and what if K is not

equal to zero zero because if you take a

periodic function that oscillates and

you integrate it then you get zero

because it's positive as much as its

negative only for K equals zero in that

case of course this doesn't oscillate

it's just equal to one then you get L so

now let's think of this as a function of

K let's draw the K axis let's go to the

K axis here's the K axis now K is not

just any number it's one of the allowed

numbers so it's discrete does anybody

remember what the allowable values of K

are

two pi in over L right in particular as

L gets bigger and bigger the distance

between neighboring values of K gets

smaller and smaller and eventually as L

gets infinitely big

these discrete intervals shrink to zero

okay so now what's the what's the

distance

let's put K equals zero K can be

positive or negative incidentally let's

put K equals zero right over here

here's K equals zero all right what's

the interval between neighboring values

of K two PI over L that's the distance

from k equals 0 or from N equals 0 to N

equals 1 for example 2 PI over L now

let's take this function this function

is a function of K of course we've

integrand sorry I've integrated it over

X it's only a function of K what is it

equal to let's plot it on here it's

equal to L when K is equal to 0 so right

at K equals 0 here it's high and it's

equal to L let's let's just give it a

slight width just for the purpose of

drawing it just for the purpose of

drawing it right at K equals 0 here it

has a height equal to L but it K not

equal to 0 its 0 that's what we

concluded at K it's equal to L if if K

is equal to 0 and it's equal to 0 if K

is not equal to 0 so how high is it its

height L how wide is it

well one interval you can't think of

anything smaller than one interval on

here it has a width

overall what's the area if I imagine

giving it that much of a width

what does the area under it 2 pi so that

means that this function is 2 pi times

the Delta function this function here is

2 pi times Delta of K Y Delta of K at K

equals 0 it's not equal to 0 at k equal

anything else it is equal to 0 now what

is the meaning of this this is the

meaning of this is in the limit of very

very large L this becomes a very very

narrow very very high function whose

area is equal to 2 pi ok we'll keep that

in mind as we go along this is called

the Dirac Delta function and we can now

say let's now go to the limit of very

large L if we go to the limit of very

large L in other words we're making

these intervals progressively smaller

and smaller we're really approaching the

situation that really does define the

Dirac Delta function then this integral

goes all the ways from minus infinity to

plus infinity so just think of this as a

formal prescription for an integral of e

to the ikx and the rule is it gives

Delta of K to PI times Delta of K this

is equal to 2 pi times Delta of K that's

something of importance that when you

integrate over a function of e to the

ikx like this DX you get a chromic are a

Dirac Delta function of K let's see if

you can guess supposing instead of doing

the integration over X I didn't I did an

integral over K exactly the same

integral except it's not at all the same

integral e to the ikx

but instead of integrating DX i

integrate BKE

what must that be it's a function of X

but it's exactly the same structure here

except I just interchanged X and K right

X and K appears symmetrically here so if

I interchange X and K this doesn't

change but I've changed the integral

over X to an integral over K so this is

now some function of X but what is the

what is the function 2pi times Delta of

X so these are two little observations

that we will see happening we'll see

their utility occurring in a number of

places well that's the Dirac Delta

function that's our first little bit of

mathematics tonight what was that

next a little bit of mathematics I

taught you what a cat is a cat is a

symbolic notation for a quantum state I

also think I told you that I didn't what

do I use I did I did I did I did and I

told you it was half of a bracket yeah

okay it's the other half of the bracket

now that we want to talk about the back

otherwise known as bra these are just

notational devices in there for our

purposes these are simply notational

devices and the question is when do you

use the bra and when do you use the cat

for our purposes we will think of cats

as initial States or a process of a

process starting with some initial state

is described by some quantum state will

describe the initial state as a ket

vector initial in final states we will

describe by

bra vectors and when you put a bra back

the next to a ket vector you make a

bracket this is simply a bunch of

symbolic manipulation but at the end

what comes out of the symbolic

manipulations are numbers okay numbers

numbers experimental numbers so I'm

going to teach you now some symbolic

manipulations for every let's go back to

the harmonic oscillator for the harmonic

oscillator we characterized the quantum

states of the harmonic oscillator by

occupation numbers n the number of

excitations of the harmonic oscillator

the number of times the number of units

of energy that's been put into the

harmonic oscillator we can also describe

it that's a ket vector that's the ket

description of a particular quantum

state we could also write it in terms of

a bra vector so far I haven't told you

anything I just told you there's two

ways to write the same thing you say

what's the difference between them not

much okay but if we are clever in our

use of this notation it will help us do

some bookkeeping that's interesting all

right now first of all there's the

notion of the inner product between a

bra vector and a ket vector now all of

this is in our past

quantum mechanics classes and I refer

you back to it we're going to go through

it lightning-like tonight if I have a

ket vector N and a bra back to M I can

put them next to each other and putting

a ket vector next to a bra vector in

this way always gives a number the kid

vectors or abstract things the bra

vectors are abstract things but the

product of two of them back to back or

front to front I'm not sure which and

that form is a number this number now n

stands for some quantum state the nth

quantum state of the oscillator and in

stands for the end state of the car of

the oscillator this number this is

definition now is equal to 0 if M is not

equal to n

and it's equal to one if n equals in so

the ball vector and the ket vector for

the same value of n have a product which

is one it's called the inner product the

inner product between these two it's one

if n equals M it's 0 if n is not equal

to M or to write it in a unified form we

can write it as Delta n n whose

definition is it's 0 unless N equals m

and 1 if n is not equal to M it's kind

of like the Dirac Delta function it's a

discrete form of the Dirac Delta

function all right this is notational

this is just notational tricks for

things now let's come to creation and

annihilation operators what I want to

get at before we go further is how

creation and annihilation operators act

on bra vectors I've told you how they

act on ket vectors and I have not told

you how they act on bra vectors now of

course you can say it eivin told you in

fact I haven't even told you the rules

which will allow you to deduce how they

act but I'm going to show you how they

act and then show you why this rule was

particularly nice alright so let's take

creation operators first of all what

does a creation operator do when it acts

on the nth quantum state of an

oscillator it multiplies it by square

root of n plus 1 times the n plus first

state what about the annihilation

annihilation gives you square root of n

times n minus 1 so one of them raises

the quantum state one of them lowers the

quantum state and in each case they

multiply by the appropriate square root

of n now we can ask death then we're

asking for a definition this is not a

theorem which we want to prove this is a

definition of how creation and

annihilation operators operate when they

act on

raw vectors so how shall we take a plus

to act on the enth bra vector and I'm

going to tell you now what the rule is

the rule is that however it acts on the

in vector it gives another vector

another bra vector of course let's

circle that bra vector and now take its

inner product with the mcat vector

however this acts whatever it gives it

gives another bra vector that's the rule

when an operator acts on a ket vector it

gives a ket vector and acts on a bra

vector it gives a bra vector and the

notation is such that when an operator

acts on a bra vector you put the

operator to the right and hit it to the

left when we acts on a ket vector so

it's a neat notation the rule is that

you get exactly the same answer as if

you did Y

times you play a quest and allow a plus

to act on em and then take the inner

product within C there's two distinct

operations however a plus should act on

it and we'd like to find out how it

should act on in we're going to define

it so that you get the same answer for

this bracket as if you allowed a plus to

act on em well I've given you the rule

for how a plus acts on em and then take

the inner product within so let's see if

we can figure out from this from this

set of abstract principles or abstract

definitions how a plus acts them in

let's see let's first take the bottom

line here the bottom line let's

calculate it it's N and now a plus acts

on em what does that give square root of

n plus one that's a number we take it

outside square root of n plus one and

then what n plus 1 what does this give

this this factor gives zero unless n is

equal to n plus 1 if n is the same as n

plus 1 then you get the number square

root of n n plus 1 which also happens to

be the square root of n of course so

that's one way of calculating what

that's this over here but notice it only

gives an answer a nonzero answer if this

is one unit higher than this sorry yeah

sorry it only gives an answer if M is

one unit lower than n if M is one unit

lower than M then a plus comes along

increases M by one unit and then we get

a nonzero answer so the only way to get

a nonzero answer is if n is one unit

lower than n

well let's look at this over here

supposing that a plus acted on in to

raise n then we would only get an answer

if M was one unit bigger than n but

according to this rule we only get a

nonzero answer if n is one I think all

right let me say let me say let me say

it accurately I get my OK from this form

we see that n has to be one unit bigger

than m to get a nonzero answer n must be

one unit bigger than M if on the other

hand a plus increased the value of n

over here then we would only get a

nonzero answer in the opposite situation

where in was one unit what less than M

so this can't be the right rule that

when a plus ax to the left that it

increases the index here what it must do

is decrease the index here and in fact

that's the definition that's the correct

definition when when a + acts on a bra

vector n it doesn't increase in it

decreases in n minus 1 and what about

the numerical factor there the correct

and Americal factor is just square root

of n if you want it if you want you can

work this out all right what if it what

about n a - what does that do well the

answer is I've given you enough rules

that you can determine yourself what it

does what it does is it increases n and

plus 1 times square root of n plus 1 in

other words to make the story short when

a + acts on ket vectors it increases in

and multiplies by square root of n plus

1

a - decreases in and multiplies by

square root of n when a plus and a minus

act on the bra vectors they just

interchange a plus decreases in and

multiplies by square root of n a -

increases in and multiplies by square

root of n plus 1 that's the rule just

that's the rule which leads to a very

lovely calculus that's useful in quantum

mechanics or calculus meaning now tricks

for computing simple things let me give

you an example let's calculate in two

distinct ways the following quantity

let's take a plus a - remember what that

was what does that stand for yes it

stands for it's a quantum mechanical

operator that stands for the occupation

number the number of quanta in the state

and let's calculate this quantity here a

- I'm sorry a - let's calculate it in

two different ways now for those have

studied some quantum mechanics you'll

know that this expression stands for the

average value of whatever this quantity

is in the quantum state in but for the

moment let's just calculate it as an

abstract the exercise but let's

calculate it two ways in the first way

let's allow this operator to act to the

right first a minus ax to the right what

does a - give what it acts on this it

gives square root of n times n minus 1

we still have a plus which we haven't

used up yet n now numbers come on the

outside numbers like square root of n

they come on the outside square root of

n now what is a plus du with an axe on n

minus 1

it pushes it back up and multiplies by

what one integer higher than what

appears here so that means again square

root of n it gives us two square roots

of n which means n times n what n a plus

n minus 1 brings us back to N and n n

what is that that's just 1 so it just

gives us in if it acts a plus a minus 1

sandwiched within the quantum state in

just gives us the numerical number in

what would happen if we did it in the

opposite in the opposite order but by

acting to the left on the bra vector

let's do it what happens when a plus

acts on end to the left it gives us n

minus 1 times the square root of n but

we still have to act with a - what does

a minus do when it acts on n minus 1

it raises you back up raises you back up

to N and gives you another square root

of n so you see with this definition

that the creation and annihilation or

the raising and lowering get

interchanged when you go to their action

on bra vectors and ket vectors then it

doesn't matter which way you imagine

these operators operate we'll get the

same answer that's a useful useful

notation and so when you see a thing

like this you don't have to ask should

you operate with this to the right and

then take the inner product with the

left hand side or should you operate to

the left and then take the inner product

to the right hand side you get the same

answer that's the beauty of that

particular definition here all right

that's good now what are we going to do

with all of this

well of course we're going to study

quantum fields which are objects built

out of these creation and annihilation

operators yeah yeah let's let's go right

there let's go to the quantum fields go

back to a simple quantum field that

we've discussed already and then come to

the description of quantum processes

scattering processes creation of

processes and violation processes and so

forth how they described by quantum

fields or how they describe in terms of

mathematical expressions involving the

quantum fields why are we interested in

processes like collisions and creation

and annihilation processes involving

particles because in the microscopic

world that's about all we can do if we

want to do experiments the only real

handles we have on experiments is

colliding particles together and see

what see what comes out and describing

those processes how the initial state of

the particle of two particles for

example morphs into some other state

involving 5 7 9 particles 4 particles

whatever it is the tool for that is

quantum field theory and we're setting

up some simple examples all right so

let's go back to the definition of a

quantum of the simplest quantum field

the simplest quantum field we took it to

be a function of only one coordinate

namely X there's no reason why we can't

think of x y&z here and make position

into a three-dimensional thing if we do

so momentum also has to be Oh

incidentally will work in units in which

H bar is equal to 1 I don't think

tonight the speed of light will come

into anything

but what's the connection between

momentum and K if H bar is equal to one

they're the same normally you would have

an H bar over here it's bar K but if H

bar is set equal to 1 K and momentum are

the same thing okay right okay so we

concocted a thing which we call the

quantum field associated with the point

of space X as I said X could be a three

dimensional point of space if it is then

K has to be three dimensional if we're

living in three dimensions then the

momentum is three dimensional meaning to

say it has three components and then K

will also have three components but

other than that the formulas I'm going

to write down are pretty much the same

in three dimensions whatever number of

dimensions were doing so I of X was a

sum over all the allowed values of

momentum if we're talking about the

universe on a circle of a periodic

universe then these are the caves which

are two PI over L times an integer if

we're talking about an infinitely big

universe then K can be any anything any

number sum over K summation of the K of

the creation operator for a particle of

momentum K times e to the minus I K X

that now has become a quantum field

there is a conjugate quantum field and

now we pretty much if we're quantum

mechanics people we talked about talked

about the hermitian conjugate if we're

classically oriented people we simply

talk about the complex conjugate you can

call it size star or side dagger of X

the complex conjugate which is a similar

thing involving annihilation operator

Ruess times e to the plus ikx yeah

is this a definition or this is

definition this is definition but you

know definitions the question it's

always appropriate when somebody gives

you a definition say why is that the

definition and then the usual answer is

wait wait till you see how we use it and

you'll see that it's a useful definition

okay so I'm afraid that's the situation

here why is this the definition because

this is a useful definition I could have

put something else here and it would

have been a useless definition so it's

it's premature to ask why this is the

definition but it is a it is a nice

simple expression not very complicated

sum over the allow about allowable

values of momentum creation operator

times e to the minus ikx or the complex

conjugate which has anihilation operator

times e to the plus ikx now I'm going to

do something even a little bit fancier

I'm going to give these I of X's some

time dependents so far they don't depend

on time the definition does involve does

not involve time but I'm going to

introduce some time into the game and

how do I introduce time why do I

introduce time well remember that

there's a connection between the

momentum the the wave vector K and the

frequency of an oscillation these are

fields these are fields fields oscillate

as is written now it doesn't oscillate

it doesn't have any time dependence if

this has anything to do with a real

field waves and so forth

we better introduce some time into it

well that's not so hard because we

remember

each value of K there is a frequency

frequency tells us how things change

with time supposing I have an object a

mathematical object which has a certain

frequency Omega how do I write the

function that goes that oscillates with

frequency Omega e to the I Omega T e to

the I Omega T which also happens of

course to be cosine Omega T plus I sine

Omega T this is a function with a

definite frequency the frequency is

omega alright now in past lectures I

pointed out to you that for various

kinds of waves each K K is a wave vector

it's inversely related to the wavelength

through H K there is a frequency so we

can say that there is for each K there

is an Omega of K and each oscillation

each time we see an e to the minus ikx

we can put in front of it an oscillation

like in front of it or behind it an e to

the I Omega of K times T now this thing

has not only space dependence but it has

time dependence and moreover it's time

to pen that we do the same thing here of

course e to the minus I Omega of K T

let's uh let's erase side dagger for the

moment we'll come back to it I want more

room on the blackboard here's an object

which has both space dependence and time

dependence the time dependence has been

arranged in such a way that for each

value of the wavelength okay

it oscillates with a time dependence

which is just the right time dependence

for that wavelength this is now a

function of space and time it truly is a

quantum field now it varies in space and

time ok I want to take an example and

show you that in the example there is an

equation of a wave equation for psy of X

and T and see if we can figure out what

the wave equation is see if we can find

the wave equation for psy of X and T

knowing the connection between Omega and

K I haven't told you what the connection

between Omega and K is but let's suppose

that we're talking about a non

relativistic particle in other words I'm

not talking about a photon I'm talking

about a species of particle which moves

with much less than the speed of light

that we're working in the approximation

in which everything is nonrelativistic

okay when h-bar is equal to 1 or over

here H bar equals 1 Omega has another

name what's there the name for Omega

energy remember the energy of a photon

or energy of a quantum of a single

quantum we're talking about a single

quantum now the energy is H bar Omega

if H bar is equal to 1 Omega and energy

are the same momentum is equal to H bar

times K so when H bar is equal to 1

energy is frequency and momentum is K is

wave number okay what's the connection

for a slowly moving particle slowly

means only slowly moving compared to the

speed of light what's the connection

between energy and momentum

[Music]

right energy of a slowly moving particle

is the square of the momentum divided by

twice the mass this is of course the

same thing as writing energy is equal to

one-half MV squared and P is equal to mV

all right if we if we solve for V and

plug it down into here we get this

relationship here okay that also tells

us now the relation between Omega and K

K squared over 2m right so now we really

do know the precise form of psy of X and

T it's a sum over the allowed values of

momentum and Omega of K is not just some

arbitrary Omega of K but it is K squared

over 2m with that proviso psy of X and T

cells are satisfies a differential

equation a wave equation let's see if we

can see what the wave equation is first

of all in wave equations derivatives

with respect to space and time enter and

are equal to each other in some form

that's what a wave equation is equations

for how space variation is related or

how time variation is related to space

variation so let's consider first the

time derivative of SCI what's the time

derivative of SCI I'm going to call it

side dot standard notation for time

derivative so I thought we get we

obtained by just differentiating the

time dependence with respect to T that's

equal to some on K a plus of K e to the

minus I KX times what times I Omega

inside the summation

I Omega of K e to the I Omega of K T all

I've done is say every time this is

still under the summation here every

time I differentiate with respect to T

it pulls down a factor of I Omega right

so that's I dot now let's look at the

space derivatives what is the space

derivative decide by DX well we do

exactly the same thing every time we

differentiate with respect to X it pulls

down a factor of minus I K so this is

equal to the same kind of thing

summation of minus I K a plus of K times

e to the minus ikx e to the I Omega of K

T so differentiating with respect to X

always just pulls down a factor of I K

differentiating with respect to time

pulls down a factor of I Omega now

there's no simple relationship between

this and this

why not because Omega is related to K

squared if Omega was simply related to K

for example if Omega had to be equal to

K then we would just say side dot is

equal to decide the X for example

imagine a world or a kind of particle

where the frequency is in fact equal to

K that's a very simple situation in that

situation I Omega K is the same as mine

is apart from a minus sign is the same

as I K and we would just say that such a

field satisfies a equation that side dot

is equal I think the minus decide by DX

is that clear all right but that's not

the case here we have to have Omega

equals K squared so how can we get K

squared take another derivative each

time we differentiate it brings down a

factor of I K so let's differentiate

again that brings us minus I K squared

what's minus I K squared

I think that's minus K squared right

minus K squared minus or the minus sign

but now K squared is 2m times Omega K

squared is 2m times Omega so let's write

that 2m times Omega and let's divide the

left-hand side by 2 n 2m is just a

number yeah

altitude is the minus sign relative

speed like I thought you get white eye

let's see let's check when I

differentiate with respect to time it

gave an eye Omega so that's all I Omega

now when I differentiate it with respect

to K it gave them a minus I K and I did

it twice so that gives minus I K squared

what is minus I K squared minus K

squared this is minus K squared so yes

as far as I can tell the minus sign is

there the there was a there was a minus

K squared and then I substituted for

minus K squared minus 2m Omega and

that's where this came from

okay I'm more familiar with this in the

form in which we divide both sides by 2

m this doesn't matter of course let's

divide it by 2 m and we get 1 over 2m

times the second derivative of the psy

with respect to space squared is omega x

all this stuff but that's clearly

proportional to side dot what's the

what's the relationship here we have it

yeah we better but let's let's yeah

there's going to be an i in the formula

we can divide by I which is the same as

multiplying by minus I okay to make a

long story short the right equation

should be minus I sigh dot that's the

kind derivative of psy divided or is

equal to 1 over 2m times the second

derivative of psy with respect to x

squared now do I have the sign right

not but of course I don't I never get it

right

okay how was your right I'm not sure

what are the two em then not one over 2m

squared 1 over 2n 1 over 2i me okay

oh let's see is the minus sign there or

not let's put a minus here and then

there's a plus here so it looks like

this it looks like it's the plus sign

far as I can tell it's the plus sign

yeah well of course that will do that

that will do the trick right okay does

anybody know the name of that equation

it's the Schrodinger equation right but

it's not the Schrodinger equation for

the same thing as an elementary quantum

mechanics an elementary quantum

mechanics sigh is just a function of

position it's not an operator it doesn't

do things it's just a thing whose square

is a probability here it is an operator

when it acts on States it creates

particles it annihilates particles this

is an instance of the relationship

between particles and quantum fields

quantum fields are operators they happen

to have the same equations as the

Schrodinger equation of elementary

quantum mechanics they are very closely

related but they're quantum mechanical

operators they're observables you can

observe them under what circumstances do

they behave like classical fields in

other words that you can measure them

and the same way you measure the

electromagnetic field the answer is that

they behave like classical fields when

the number of quanta is very large the

number of quanta is large then the

magnitudes of the fields a law

arge and the quantum fluctuations are

small or quantum uncertainties are small

exactly like a harmonic oscillator a

harmonic oscillator if it's got a big

motion behaves classically if it's only

got one quantum unit of excitation it

behaves very quantum mechanically so

this is an example as I said of a

quantum field and it has creation and

annihilation operators in it

nevertheless it's a thing which

satisfies an equation then the equation

is the Schrodinger equation this is

obviously a more advanced notion of the

Schrodinger wave function then just

saying it's a thing whose square is the

probability for a given particle it's

something a little bit different okay

and as I said it is a quantum field it's

the simplest version of a quantum field

[Music]

how do we use it how do we use it to

describe processes so I'm going to give

you any and we've already talked about

this a little bit what I didn't talk

about in which I want to come to now is

energy and momentum conservation and how

energy and momentum conservation are

codified or codify above the right word

is in the various dependences of sigh

and the way that we describe various

processes I want to I want to imagine

now describing the very very simplest

process in which a particle scatters off

a target the target in this case is a

thing which is so heavy that it doesn't

recoil the particle comes in either

reflects off it or scatters off it in

three dimensions it could have its

trajectory changed in other words it

could be coming in from the left and go

off straight ahead but what can you say

about a particle scattering off an

ordinary target

are just stuck there it doesn't move

stays there forever and ever which of

the conservation laws would you expect

to be true for that particle

how about momentum

the refraction reflection is what's a

refresh reflect reflection refraction

and absorption well let's forget

absorption for the moment all right

the particle comes in and goes out so

it's not absorbed but yes it could be

reflected bing-bang it could be

refracted in which case its direction of

motion has changed in any case the

momentum of that particle generally is

not the same coming in as going out of

course secretly what happens is momentum

is really conserved but what happens is

of course the target absorbs some of the

momentum but let's just fix the target

let's imagine nailing down the target

and the target is not part of our

mathematical description or the motion

of the target is not part of our

mathematical description then in the

mathematical description of a particle

scattering of a target the momentum of

the particle is not conserved all right

what about the energy yeah the energy of

the particle is conserved if you take a

tennis ball well a tennis ball is a bad

example because it you know it heats up

when you throw it against the wall but

an idealized tennis ball where you can

ignore heat you throw it against the

wall and it bounces off what can you say

about the way that it bounces off you

can't say that momentum is conserved the

momentum has gone from that direction to

that direction but the energy is

conserved so how can we see can we see

that in some simple model of the

scattering process that momentum is not

conserved and energy is conserved using

these wave fields so we talked about

this last time a little bit and I showed

you how you could describe a process of

scattering creation and annihilation and

so forth using these quantum fields so

here is a

model here is a space as horizontal time

is vertical and the axis over here

represents a target it's it's fixed in

space it neither and it goes on and on

forever into the past it just sits there

and a particle comes in it hits the

target at some point and either bounces

off or goes forward or scatters into

some other direction so we described the

initial state by saying this one

particle with a momentum ke let's call

it K in for initial initial or incoming

and then a particle goes off having

scattered off the target and let's use a

language now it's absorbed by the target

and suddenly remit it by the target okay

think of it instead of just thinking of

it as bouncing off the target let's in

the back of our mind have a picture in

which it is absorbed or annihilated by

the target and then instantaneously

recreated by the target but possibly

with a different momentum let's call

that final momentum K final let's just

call it K I and K F initial and final

and what are we interested in we're

interested in the probability amplitude

the quantum mechanical probability

amplitude that the particle scatters

from momentum K initial to K final now

one more ingredient I'm going to assume

that the scattering can happen with

equal strength equal at any time always

at the same place we're going to place

the target at x equals zero but we're

going to assume that the scattering

process can occur at any time whatever

time that

particle gets there it will scatter or

not scatter or do whatever it does but

with no special dependence on the time

at which the process takes place that's

going to be our graph our basic

assumption how do we describe the event

of the particle being absorbed at

position x equals zero

well we describe that by means this

should be side dagger shouldn't it I

think this should be sorry dagger

it's the daggers or the go with the plus

sides here I think in my invitation that

I use I think a plus always what with a

minus here I think so and then this one

would be plus if I remember okay we

described it in the following by a kind

of bookkeeping it's all bookkeeping but

it's useful bookkeeping you absorb the

particle this is a piece this is a field

which creates particles let's write down

the other conjugate field which

annihilates particles

that's the complex conjugate or sign of

X and T which is made up out of

annihilation operators e to the plus ikx

e to the minus I Omega of K T it's just

the every place everything is conjugated

e to the minus ikx becomes e to the plus

ikx and so forth and these are to be

thought of as complex conjugates of each

other or hermitian conjugates of each

other alright let's imagine first of all

absorbing the particle at the origin how

do we do that we absorb it by an

operator where we start with the initial

state the initial state has no particles

with any particular momentum

X

set one particle with momentum ki so if

we describe it in terms of occupation

numbers only the occupation number

associated with momentum ki would be

nonzero we can also just label that by

saying this one particle with momentum

ki and be done with it

we don't need to specify all the

particles that aren't there but

nevertheless it's useful to keep in mind

that when we specify the initial state

with specifying all of the occupation

numbers of all the various quanta and

only one of them according to assumption

here is present so there's our one here

and all the others are zero and we just

label it by saying what was one particle

momentum ki then that particle is either

is annihilated at the origin if it's if

it's at the origin and let's describe

that by psy of X and T but X is equal to

0 0 and T why is x equals 0 and assuming

that if the process happens it happens

at the target and the target is at x

equals 0 but it can happen at any time

so that's the process of absorbing the

particle at time T that's what this says

but then the particle is immediately

recreated that's why you say why does it

have to be it doesn't have to be that's

the model that I'm making a particle

absorbed and we immediately remit it

that's a mathematical model it's not

necessarily a law of nature about any

particular kind of particle in fact in

the real world a photon can be absorbed

by an atom and emitted later or earlier

so what we're talking about here is a

simple mathematical model in which the

process happens all at an instant

particle absorbed in Rhian aisle and

readmitted

now what's the omission described by its

described by the creation of a particle

also at point zero so that's side dagger

of 0 and the same time T but what time

what time should I put there the same

time but which time it will matter so

why why 1 or 0 how about let's say it

can happen at any time any time that the

particle gets there okay whenever the

particle gets there that's the same as

saying integrate this over all possible

times in other words there is a process

in which the particle absorbs absorbed

at this time at this time at this time

and so forth so let's not prejudice what

time it happens by just averaging or

integrating over all possible times this

is a mathematical expression which we

can work out I will show you as we go

along with the implications of this

integral over time R but the basic

physics of it is that the process could

happen at any time no special time no

particular time is singled out is

special and we get rid of the

specialness of the value of time by just

integrating over all values of time what

does this give this gives the final

state here's an initial State these are

operators which operate on the initial

state and give some final state how do

we calculate the probability that the

final state consists of one and only one

particle moving with some other momentum

all right if you remember your rules of

quantum mechanics we take the inner

product of this state with the final

state

so let's say one particle with momentum

K final this is a number remember a ket

vector operator bra vector give us some

kind of number is this number the

probability for the scattering not quite

we have to square it we have to take the

absolute value of it and square it now

I've left out one important ingredient

in this expression we're going to

evaluate this we're going to go through

it and we're going to see what it says e

because I'm I'm purposefully not

purposefully I would rather be able to

explain all of this in complete logical

order but you know given an hour to do

all of quantum field theory we have to

draw on things that we've done in the

past so in the past I explained that

probabilities are squares of amplitudes

and amplitudes are inner products

between initial States and final States

ok so here's the thing we want to

calculate but I've left one thing out

I've left out the strength of the

scatterer the strength of the scatterer

is a measure of the strength of

interaction between the scatterer and

the scan scatter e so let me give you an

example you could have a charged

particle at the origin which is

scattering a photon a photon comes in is

absorbed by the scatterer and re-emitted

what is in that case what corresponds to

the strength of the scatterer

the answer is the electric charge of the

charge the bigger the electric charge

the more probable it is that the

electron that the photon will get

scattered there is a measure of the

strength of the interaction between

scatterer and scattered particle the

strength of the coupling between them

which which has to be codified somehow

and it is simply by a numerical number

put here it's called the coupling

constant G G for what I don't know what

G is for it's a measure of the strength

of the coupling or the strength of the

interaction between the scatterer and

between the scatterer or the target and

the particle itself I'll give an example

some examples the scattering of a meson

from a proton is a strong process

meaning to say that if the Mazon is

absorbed if the Mazon arrives at the

location of the proton it has a high

probability of scattering that's

indicated by a large coupling constant a

photon in the vicinity of a charged also

could be a proton a photon is also

absorbed and re-emitted by a proton the

probability for that scattering the

probability that the photon gets

redirected is much smaller than the

probability for the Mazon and that's

indicated by the coupling constant being

much smaller for the interaction of a

charged particle with a year you think

of something even smaller yeah on the

tree now interacting with a proton has

an even smaller constant for scattering

off this that's what made for the target

being an electron of the well right now

we just right now we're just making a

model in fact of an electron or

something like an electron scattering

off target so this is don't think of

this as being valid for any real thing

this is a simplified model for a cell

for a number of different situations

what about the scattering of a graviton

by a by a nucleus graviton is the analog

for gravity of a photon well it can

happen but it's an extreme

small constant I won't even try to tell

you how 10,000 minus some large number

by comparison alright so the strength of

the interaction and the probability that

this actually happens the particle gets

redirected is indicated or described by

the coefficient G which appears here

it's just a number now it's called the

coupling constant what's called a

coupling constant there are many

coupling constants all right so let's

see if we can calculate this what are we

telling to calculate we're trying to

calculate the probability or going from

K initial to K final that's all yeah is

there any logic for G be in a constant

as opposed to being a function of Omega

okay

hmm that's a good question the answer is

there is no logic to it no there is

logic to it but there are situations

where it's a function of Omega all right

I will I'll show you some situations as

I said this is a model of a particular

kind of simple scattering there are more

complicated kinds of scattering a more

complicated kind would be and this would

really be for the case of a photon in an

atom for example photon comes in atom

gets excited and then D excites by

emitting the photon okay here is a

little gap a time gap between the time

the photon is absorbed the time it's

emitted this happens to be equivalent to

saying that the coupling constant is

Omega dependent okay so as I said we're

talking about a simple model and just

trying to find what the consequences

what the consequences are there's going

to be one important consequence and it

is very general the rest is not so

general but the one important

consequence that I want to get to so

let's just plug away

we're going to just go straight ahead

plugging in for sy its value written in

terms of creation and annihilation

operators and then use those creation

and annihilation operators to annihilate

the initial particle and recreate the

final particle and calculate the

expression that's up there the square of

it will be the probability so let's do

it okay so yeah if G is equal to one

yeah all right um that's a good question

well you could ask what happens if G is

much bigger than one does that mean that

the probability is much bigger than one

no it doesn't it doesn't it just means

that you have to go ahead into a more

complicated calculation this calculation

that I'm doing is only correct for a

very small G okay it's correct for very

small G what you have to do in G is

larger is extremely interesting and will

be very important to us and what follows

the answer is you have to do higher

order perturbation theory okay but we're

not doing that now well we're just doing

the simplest thing all right so let's do

the simplest thing and just plug in for

psy its value all right sigh the first

sign up a side dagger but the first side

is a summation over K naught K initial

which is K a summation index a minus to

absorb the initial particle of ke e to

the ikx

e to the minus I Omega sub K T and that

acts on the initial state which happens

to have one particle of momentum ki yeah

hmm thank you X is zero at the scatterer

so let's leave it out e to the ikj Rho

is just 1 which terms in this sum will

contribute only when K is equal to ki

will we get anything right why because

the annihilation operators gives zero

when they act on states where there are

no particles the only particle around

has momentum ki and so only when K is

equal to ki 2 we get anything but

nevertheless let's leave it in this form

just for the moment now what about the

other operator side dagger that's also a

sum over momentum I better use a

different index because I don't want to

use the same summation index twice get

confused so I'll call it let's call it L

and now we put a plus of L that creates

the new particle with momentum L times e

to the well X is still equal to zero X

is still equal to zero so we don't get

anything from here but then we have e to

the I Omega sub L times T what about the

final state the final state is the state

with a particle of momentum K final okay

which term are first of all the term in

the sum of a k which contributes is only

when K equals K I right what about the

sum here over L what does l have to

equal K final remember that when a plus

ax to the left it annihilates it has to

find a particle to annihilate a plus of

L only gives

something when L is equal to K final so

really both of these sums collapse only

K equals K initial and L equals K final

the taller is what did I leave out G

but I've also left out something else

where is it

integral DT it's the integral DT which

is the thing that I'm really interested

in all right so the only contributor

here is K equals K I what does a minus

of K I do and it acts on a state with

momentum K I it just creates a state

with no particles right it annihilates

the particle with momentum kie what

about this sum this sum is only nonzero

when L is equal to K final so we can put

K final here

and when this acts on a state with K

final oh sorry yeah okay right we're

okay

this is good what happens when a acts on

the state with K initial it just gives a

state with no particles right so that's

just no particles what happens when this

acts on the state with particle with

momentum K final it just gives no

particles again what is this number one

so that much is one so all this operator

nonsense of creating and annihilating

particles all goes away and all we have

is a number G that's the probability for

the scattering or that's the amplitude

for the scattering G nothing else except

that we have this integral not in this

expression I think you're thinking about

a relativistic problem no no there was

only one particle here because there was

only one particle yeah yeah it was only

one particle right okay but the

important thing the real only thing that

really I'm illustrating here is the

integral over time and what is it it's

an integral DT e to the I Omega let's

just call it final minus Omega initial

this is K initial times T that's the

whole upshot the time integration gives

us an integral over e to the I Omega

final minus Omega initial T all of the

operator nonsense just gives us a 1

nothing very interesting the coupling

constant gives us a G and now we have to

evaluate this integral what is this

integral

Delta function this is an example of the

Delta function an integral DT of e to

the I something times T let's see was it

2pi times the Delta function if I

remember I think it was 2 pi G times

Delta of Omega final minus Omega initial

is this ring a bell Delta of Omega final

minus Omega initial it's only nonzero

when Omega final is equal to Omega

initial Omega final is the final energy

Omega initial is the initial energy so

somehow magically now notice that if we

had not integrated over time we would

not have gotten this Delta function of

energy so somehow there's a connection

between the fact that that there's a

conservation of energy and the fact that

it doesn't that there's no preference

for any specified time we could have

made a model in which the scattering

only happens if the time is within some

boundaries then this integral would have

only gone over some limited amount of

time it would not have made a delta

function so the ingredient here which is

closely connected with with energy

conservation is time translation

symmetry that every time is like every

other time yeah

Oh Oh the square of the Delta function

well yeah yeah yeah the probability the

for the probability we have to square

this this is the probability amplitude

the probability itself will have the

square of this but who cares about the

square of a delta function the Delta

square of a Delta function is also zero

if Omega final is not equal to we have

to worry about squares of Delta

functions but in any case this will be

zero unless the initial energy is the

same as the final energy let's assume

the initial energy is the same as the

final energy then this is the operative

important part of the scattering

amplitude let's call this by its name

it's a scattering amplitude and the

probability for the scattering is

proportional to 4pi squared g squared

right the strength of the scatterer or

the probability for it to scatter

contains G squared they always wind up

containing PI's but the important thing

is the G squared and which which fun

which final momenta can happen well I

didn't specify anything special about

the final momentum here this final

momentum could have been anything as

long as the energy was the same so this

scatter has the property that it takes a

particle and with a probability

proportional to G squared changes its

momentum with equal probability to any

momentum with the same energy that's it

so this is a scatterer

which can scatter into any direction

with equal probability okay any

direction with equal probability that of

course is not true of all scatterers

this is this very simple model that

scatters with all with equal probability

in all directions and the coefficient G

squared 4 PI squared G squared in this

case is the probability

so this is I really I've shown you many

things so far tonight

in particular the definition of a

coupling constant the fact that the

integration over time is the thing which

ensures energy conservation which is

just another way of saying the problem

has time translation symmetry there was

nothing specif special picked out about

one time or another time and and I've

Illustrated the idea of a scattering

amplitude or the amplitude the thing

which becomes squared in order to

calculate a probability this is a fairly

generic set of ideas but the sped the

details can differ you can always find

stands by by defining 0 x is 0

say mama can you always simplify this by

redefining the position so X is zero

yeah good question yes yes in this

particular case yes the question of what

would happen

had you not put x equals zero here right

that's that's kind of the question okay

what you would have found is it would

have been another factor the other

factor in here would have been in the

amplitude e to the I K initial minus K

final times the position of the

scatterer what should I call a position

of the scatterer okay just let's just

call it X of the scatterer

X of the target X on the target is a

number X of the target is just the

position of the target when the position

of the target was zero this didn't occur

if the target was moved over to position

X target you would get an extra factor

but what will happen to the probability

no change because the when you square

meaning to say when you multiply by the

complex conjugate this goes away

multiplying this by its own complex

conjugate which is what I mean by

squaring multiplying by its own complex

conjugate this goes away so this does

not appear in the probability they're

the same probability no matter where the

target is but in an intermediate stage

of calculation in calculating the the

amplitude the position of the target

would occur

yeah so it's very simple models you can

cram two years into our young but the

mathematics unless I see it wrong seems

to say if we said that it didn't matter

where it happened but it happened

exactly at time zero we'd get a

different conservation yes for you guess

the conservation momentum momentum

there's no energy conservation right

right a design a physical interpretation

or is this more property well of course

in the real world that we're studying

for example the interaction of two

particles and we take everything into

account both particles and so forth the

scattering can occur at any time at any

place right ah but you could imagine you

can certainly imagine an approximate

situation where you might okay you're

asking me is there ever a situation

where here the approximation was we just

ignored the recoil of the target okay

and therefore the momentum was not

conserved is there ever a situation

where energy is not conserved and that

sort of situation is what happens when

you have time dependence in the coupling

car or time dependence in the strength

of interaction now yes there certainly

are situations where that can be a good

approximation to say something something

makes a sudden change in the system from

the outside and when a sudden change in

the system happens that's when the

scattering takes place yes we can think

of situations where that happens I can

where we can do we can try to concoct

one I can't right now I'm a little fuzzy

but yes we can certainly concoct a

situation where something sudden happens

in such a way that it makes the

scattering possible at an instant of

time and then energy

not conservative right most of the

coupling constants come from

experimental data yeah well so you just

said introducing and time dependence in

the coupling constants well that usually

means when there's a time dependence in

the coupling constant it usually means

is something that you've ignored in the

system which is either moving or time

dependent something whose dynamics and

degrees of freedom you're sort of

ignoring in the same way that you

ignored the possible recoil or

repositioning of the target here so I

will try to think of a situation where

where there's an interesting violation

of energy conservation or where the

bookkeeping was such that you threw some

of the energy away but let's come back

to it yeah hitting a moving target

hitting a moving target right hitting a

moving target there's an example where

the target where they were again the

motion of the target is thought of as

completely I on certain skills you have

to worry about the size of the target

versus the yes the frequency of the the

size of the wait yes so electron versus

x-ray versus gamma versus yeah here in

this model Atari the size of the target

was zero yeah in this right and you're

absolutely right something interesting

happens when the target has a certain

finite size and we can we can discuss

that but let me just come back to the

question about the moving the moving

target if you think about it for a

minute of course if you have a moving

target energy is not conserved for

example supposing that wall was moving

toward me and I had a tennis ball and

all of a sudden the wall hits the ball

and the ball moves off the energy of the

of the tennis ball we're not accounting

for the energy of the moving wall we're

not trying to worry about that so if the

wall is moving that corresponds to a

time dependence in this case a time

dependence not of a coupling constant

but at a time dependence of the location

the scatterer that would be enough to

make energy not conserved and we could

see it in the in the mathematical

formalism okay so to reiterate these

creation and annihilation operators are

the tools which allow you to discuss

transitions of particles from one state

to another state um we have not talked

about

well actually we could talk about

creation and annihilation yeah let's

let's discuss another situation Oh

incidentally supposing psy was the field

operator for an electron each kind of

particle has its own separate field

okay so electrons have a different field

than photons when you put psy here you

better specify what particle you're

talking about

um let's think of the electron sorry

describes electrons now here was a

process in which an electron came in and

an electron came went out what happened

to the total charge did the total charge

change no one particle came in went a

particle come out now let's imagine a

different situation let's imagine a

situation where one electron comes in

and two electrons go out okay crazy I

mean it can't happen but let's for a

moment nevertheless try to imagine it

how might we describe it by the same

kind of mathematics one electron comes

in two electrons go out how do i modify

this and Theia my simple model is two

electrons go out from exactly the same

point yeah we might put another we might

square this in other words sigh of zero

Teesside dagger of 0 Teesside dagger of

0 t sigh of zero

tea oops this should be a tea here right

yeah okay what about now this is this of

course can't happen in nature because

electric charge is conserved this

corresponds to the annihilation of one

electron and the creation of - bad idea

but nevertheless let's write it down

what about two electrons in and two

electrons out is that okay well at least

it doesn't violate electric charge

conservation how would we describe that

another sigh sigh sigh sigh dagger side

dagger how about two electrons in three

electrons out sigh sigh side dagger side

dagger side dagger okay which one's of

these are allowed and what's the rule

I'm not the writing a rule now we're

just going to observe same number of

patient in a laser right same number of

size as side daggers this is not allowed

this is allowed this is not allowed rule

is same number of size aside anger

automatic vertical yeah it's not a

question of the order of the operators

it's the number of size versus the

number of side daggers when the number

of size hi let's when the number of size

is different than the number of side

daggers versus when the number of size

is the same as the number of side

daggers how can you diagnose these

combinations of course it's it's very

easy just to count them

of sizes inside daggers of course but

let me give you a mathematical

diagnostic that really does have a deep

meaning let's imagine a transformation

now side dagger does mean the complex

conjugate of side it is the hermitian

conjugate in the language of quantum

mechanics but the hermitian conjugate is

the analog of quiet of complex conjugate

let me imagine that I take an expression

like this just a mathematical expression

like this and I transform sigh by

multiplying it by a phase a phase means

an e to the I times some number let's

call it alpha times I I just I'm just

doing now blindly playing a game

wherever I see psy I multiply it by e to

the I alpha times side what happens to

side dagger if I multiply a complex con

or quantity by e to the I alpha what

happens to its complex conjugate e to

the minus I alpha side dagger what

happens to objects that have an equal

number of science i dagger they stay the

same what happens to objects which don't

have an equal number of science are

dagger they change so we could

characterize the allowed processes by

the ones which are described by

operators which are invariant unchanged

by the operation of changing the phase

of the operator now that indeed but for

the moment let's give it a simpler name

invariance under changing under

redefining the field so that you change

its phase and overall everybody know you

change the phase by a constant phase

factor if the

option if the interaction expression

here is invariant then charge is

conserved if it is non invariant then

charge is not conserved what happens

supposing I had side plus side dagger

what kind of thing does that correspond

to incidentally or I'll leave that to

you to think about but is this is this

unchanged by your base this is the real

part of Sai and if you multiply by a

phase you change the real part of sorry

so that's not a quantity which is

invariant inclusion should be done good

then you have an electron in Picchu in

eternity young live that many signal

data electronically no wait

if you have what kind of target target

full of electrons well sure you can have

yes yes yes yeah right

oh you say what happens if you have an

atom and you hit the atom with an

electron and seventy-five electrons go

off well charge is not violated of

course what has happened is the atom has

changed all right all right this is a

situation in which you cannot get away

with ignoring the dynamics of the target

in the particular the the important

dynamics of the target is the change of

charge of the target you can't in this

case treat the target is always a

completely passive thing you've got to

remember right what's that

yes that means the target itself has to

be described by a quantum field all

right and we can discuss that I think

we've gone far enough for tonight

all right so what do we found we found

that time translation invariance

corresponds to energy conservation phase

invariance we can call this phase

invariance corresponds to charge

conservation

and we haven't worked it out yet we will

work it out next time that spatial

translation invariance corresponds to

momentum conservation I'll show you how

that works next time but we're making

our way slowly into how particle physics

processes are described by fields that's

our goal for the for the next one more

lecture on it I don't know maybe half a

lecture on it and then we'll move into

some of the symmetries and some of the

more interesting laws of particle

physics sighs yes yes but it's not hard

to Rihanna

that's great I've chosen always to put

all the daggers to the left and the

sides to the right remind me next time

and I'll show you how to rearrange other

expressions so that they become like

this I know what you're asking you're

asking what would happen if instead of

this we put Sai Sai dagger sai Sai

dagger and I will tell you next time but

they still not this is allowed no not

quite not quite not quite not quite

remind me next time I'm too tired now to

start going into it but remind me

absolutely next time what is the

difference between this and this and

I'll show you next time

all right I left I actually left time

for some questions if you want to ask

some questions I just have run out of

steam in well it's not a trivial if you

have as many sides of side daggers that

means the interaction eats the same

number of electrons as it spits out all

right each side annihilates an electron

each side Dagger creates in a way all I

did was point out that all of the

objects with equal numbers of size and

side daggers will be invariant under the

phase operation here if they have

different numbers of size and side

daggers let's take a case yes I side

dagger side dagger you get it right I'm

not sure what the rest of the question

is if they have equal numbers of size

and side daggers it's phase invariant

and it conserves charge if has different

numbers of size and side daggers it's

not phase invariant and it doesn't

conserved charge so we're just observing

that when it's phase invariant it

conserves charge when it's not phasing

very they're Twitter

energy-momentum in charge for the moment

we haven't we haven't gone through a

momentum conservation although was

mentioned by somebody here asked me if

the process can happen at any place

instead of any time then yes then it

conserves momentum but we'll come to it

will do that case yeah in classical

mechanics it's north is theorem in

quantum mechanics it's even simpler but

[Music]

but here I'm sort of short-circuiting

all of that discussion by just showing

you how it works mechanically in in

terms of these quantum fields well

there's the availability of that first

system that is uh PI Square D square

that means when you empirically assign a

value to the coffee classes that must be

one over two days it must be less than

one over something or you have or your

model is very incomplete if you ask me

in what way it's incomplete I will tell

you in what way it's incomplete

is that the real scattering process is

not described by just a particle coming

in and getting scattered out it's

described by something more complicated

which is a sum of problem of sum of

amplitudes in which the particle comes

in scatters off the target comes in goes

back out comes back in scatters off the

target twice comes back in scatters off

the target three times it's a whole

infinite series each one each term has a

factor of G in front of it it's only

when G is small that only the first term

is important but we'll come to that this

is this is a basic theme that when the

coupling constant is small you can get

away with the simplest minimal process

when the coupling constant gets large

one has to well let's just call it what

it is one has to sum up an infinite

number of finding graphs basically these

pictures that I've drawn are Fineman

graphs and the vertices of the Fineman

graphs are described by these operators

okay the vertices of the Fineman

diagrams tell you the basic elements

that can happen particle comes in

bounces back out that's side times side

dagger two particles come in and bounce

back out that's side agus ID agus ëyesí

or whatever and we'll we'll give things

their proper name next time

now are there any situations when

coupling constant has imaginary

component well yes

fatality you want you who you want me

the existence of a theta proper ammeter

in QCD he the existence of a theta

parameter in QCD I'm sure that means

nothing to you yeah it is it does happen

that there are complex values of a

coupling constants it usually means the

time reversal invariance has been broken

complex coupling constants usually

indication of a violation of of time

reversal invariance that's really what

it comes down to now you can't see that

from what I've told you up till now at

least if you can you're smarter than I

am I can see it but only because I know

how to see it but it's not obvious but

that is the case complex coupling

constants mean that time reversal

invariance is is is broken in other

words things don't look if you run the

process backward as a movie going

backward it's not a possible process

this is that at one point also that

instead of having me the scattering

occurred the outgoing particle the same

time as the inter particle can be before

or after you also mention before I do

not have not now right now yeah no no I

did say that and I sort of regretted it

the minute I said it but we we will we

will now this is it's a fair question

but it's not the time for it now yeah

deputy frame that used to say that last

before your ticket once then Jean

Franklin would say it laughs before you

tickle it okay problem to say you'll get

this at some point how do you turn this

into something that's relativistic ah

again you're jumping way ahead I'm

trying to go slowly and everybody's

pushing me to get ahead okay are you

really want to know you add this in this

and put a square root of Omega K in the

denominator nah nah leave it we're

jumping ahead

and you talk about charms conjugation

conservation conservation with a phase

factor yard but the best maxium that

doesn't change also in a non

relativistic process but in a

relativistic process it can and there's

nothing in basic quantum mechanics which

says that rest mass can't change it's a

combination of quantum mechanics or not

even quantum mechanics even just

classical mechanics together with an

invariance principle and the invariance

principle is Galilean invariance which I

had which is an analogue of non

relativistic analogue of Lorentz

invariance but yeah it is true in

nonrelativistic situation total mass

can't change but it can in relativistic

scattering so what do you want to ask me

exactly well is this that logically we

think of rest mass conservation of the

same terms as charge no no no no no no

not at all not at all one is absolutely

true in nature the other the other is

only true for very very slow velocities

right there is nothing sacred in physics

about the conservation of rest mass and

then what's more is not true an electron

and a positron annihilate into two

photons there's no conservation of mass

there is a conservation of electric

charge so one of them is a sort of

accidental nonrelativistic fact the

other is a deep underlying symmetry of

nature which happens in simple case just

to correspond to this phase invariance

next time we'll talk about fermions

we'll talk about what happens if you

have more than one species of particles

supposing you have electrons and muons

and quarks and so forth how do you

describe all of this what's allowed

what's not allowed the kind of processes

all in the language of the scatterer

again big Amos said it was an electron

but I thought we only knew about photos

ah good point good point good point good

point

yes yes yes yes good point yeah this so

we have we're talking about a boson

occasion of an electron yeah sorry I

completely missed that you're right

right but there are particles in nature

which carry electric charge yeah right

exactly a charged pine is on a slowly

moving charged pine Mazon would be an

example of a boson which you would

describe in this way yeah yeah so good

absolutely all right thank you for more
