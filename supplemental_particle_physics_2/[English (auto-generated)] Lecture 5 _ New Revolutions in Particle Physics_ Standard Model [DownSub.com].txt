Stanford University all right we've

really studied two different theories a

little bit quantum electrodynamics and

quantum chromodynamics both of them are

gauge theories in fact just about all of

nature as we know it in one way or

another is controlled by gauge theories

of different kinds and so I ought to

tell you what a gauge theory is now I'm

not going to get into any depth what

gauge symmetry is I'm going to tell you

what gauge what a gauge Theory is in

more or less the minimal mathematical

way first and simplest gauge theory is

Maxwell's theory Maxwell's theory of

light or Maxwell's theory of

electromagnetism let's not worry about

what the word gauge means when we may go

through it later but not now

but what it is is a theory of fields

which have all of the properties of the

electromagnetic field the

electromagnetic field has six components

three components of electric field three

components of magnetic field you can

represent those six components in terms

of a four vector called the vector

potential I'll just write it down for

you where it's not going to play any big

role today anyway

but just to tell you there's a four

vector that's generally called a and it

has an index mu it has four components a

zero that's the time component of it and

the three space components a one two and

three or a x y&z let's not write them

out in detail so it contains a three

vector and a fourth component a not the

significance of a nought is that it's

the electrostatic potential it's the

thing whose gradient is the

check force okay so for example the

electric force on a charged particle

it's just gotten by multiplying the

electric charge by the gradient or the

derivative F X derivative of a not with

respect to X so it's just the

electrostatic potential it's measured in

volts or in particle physics of course

it's not measured in volts volts per

unit charge excuse me

both yeah measured in in whatever way

you measure electrostatic potential

that's the meaning of a nought I notice

first of all oh and of course this is

the electric field this is the electric

field it has three components derivative

with respect to X Y or Z so it's the

gradient the gradient of a right and the

gradient of a is just called the

electric field so the electric field is

determined by the gradient of a knot and

the magnetic field is determined by also

derivatives also derivatives of the

vector potential and in fact the

magnetic field is the curl of the vector

potential so one of two ways you can

study electrodynamics either in terms of

the electric and magnetic fields of

which there are six or in terms of the

vector potential of which there are four

but they're equivalent descriptions of

electrodynamics and we won't we won't go

into Maxwell's equations but let me just

remind you that Maxwell's equations give

rise to electromagnetic waves an

electromagnetic wave is a wave of

electric and magnetic field and a

typical electric magnetic wave has a

direction in space that it moves let's

just represent it by an arrow and it has

a polarization to understand what the

polarization means you have to think

about the electric and magnetic fields

and the electron-electron

here's the electric field for example

the whole thing moves with the speed of

light but at any given instant the

electric field might look like that and

the magnetic field is always

perpendicular to the electric field try

to draw see if I can give a drawing it's

a imagine in the electric field is in

the horizontal plane and it's always

perpendicular to thee let's see is this

going to it's always perpendicular like

so in appropriate units the electric and

magnetic field are equal to each other

and perpendicular this would be a plane

polarized electromagnetic wave and the

plane polarized electromagnetic wave the

direction of polarization which of

course is always perpendicular to the

direction of motion the direction of

polarization is determined by the

electric field so the electric field

determines the direction of polarization

and that's electromagnetism and a lots

electromagnetic waves in a nutshell the

other thing of course about

electromagnetic waves is that there are

sources the sources are charges and

currents but let's particularly focus on

the sources of the electric field the

sources of the electric field are

electric charge and to just draw a

picture to put it at the level of

pictures every electric charge creates

an electric field the electric field

lines never end

except on other charges a positive

convention the convention is a positive

electric charge puts out a electric

field which is radially outward falls

off as one over R squared you can

imagine that the number of electric

field lines coming out of a charge is

fixed proportional to the charge and the

for the number of electric field lines

passing through any sphere is the same

no matter how far the sphere is to say

that mathematically the integral of the

electric field over the sphere is the

same wherever you go however far out you

go that's Gauss's law but Scouse is law

and that Gauss's law has a very strong

consequence if you don't have any other

charges in the system let's say just a

plus charge then you can't get and the

rule is electric lines only end on

charges then there's no way to get rid

of a charge no way to get it rid of a

charge if you try to get rid of the

charge either the electric field has to

suddenly disappear Everywhere's that

would violate the rules of the speed of

light that you can't send a signal

faster than the speed of light so

instead if you said that a wave moved

outward of missing electric field that

also wouldn't make sense not unless

there were charges at the endpoints of

the electric field so all this would

really be is this would not be the

elimination of the charge it would just

be taking the charge and sending it out

as a shell would be a shell of charge

going out the charge would not have

disappeared so it's a consequence of

deep consequence of the structure the

mathematical structure Gauss's law and

other laws that electric charge is

conserved that is the arm essence of a

gauge Theory essence of a gauge theory

maxwell like fields i'll use the word

maxwell like because they're not all

truly Maxwell's electromagnetic

filled maxwell like fields consisting of

electric like and magnetic like fields

if the a life the gauge field is weakly

coupled and i will tell you what that

means later but it basically means that

if the interactions between the parts of

the electromagnetic field are weak

enough that they don't interact with

each other seriously then the motion of

a gauge field is exactly the same as a

light wave that will have a polarization

it will move down the axis with the

speed of light unless something else

unless it's something in the dynamics

that changes that are naively at least

it's in every way similar to the

electromagnetic field the only

difference is it also has sources every

gauge field has sources analogous to the

electric charge but it may not be the

electric charge it might be something

else let me give you an example which is

an unphysical example unphysical not

because it's inconsistent but because it

just happens not to be true as far as we

know there is another quantity in nature

called the baryon number it's simply the

number of quarks

juster but it's a conserved quantity and

you could imagine that baryon number is

the source of our Burien number is not

electric charge why not well because

protons and neutrons have it so it is

not electric charge but it could be the

source of its own gauge field if it were

that would mean that there would be

forces between protons neutrons protons

protons neutrons neutrons that would be

analogous to the Coulomb forces between

charges except they would have nothing

to do with electric charge they would

have only to do with baryon number so

for example two

Jex with the same baryon number would

repel each other a proton and a neutron

would repel each other because they have

the same baryon number a proton and a

proton would repel on the other hand

proton and antiproton having opposite

baryon number would attract now the only

rub in this ointment is that there is no

such gauge field coupled to the baryon

number baryon number does not come with

a field like this that surrounds it and

no long-range force associated with it

so Berrien number is not an example

color is an example and the color forces

of quantum chromodynamics also or before

i do that one one or two other points

one or two other points the other point

of course is this is a completely

classical description of an

electromagnetic wave the corresponding

quantum mechanical description is in

terms of quanta but of course if we

think of quanta as particles at least

that's the about the only mental picture

that we have to describe these do these

discrete little objects the discreet

little objects which drawing them of

course is always misleading but let me

draw our photon is a photon a little

point that little photon has a position

moves of the speed of light but also it

has a little flag associated with it and

that little flag is this polarization I

won't try to draw a flag on it in other

words it has a pointer which either

points this way this way or somewhere is

in between that indicates the

polarization of the electromagnetic wave

of which it is a quantum that's a

complicated statement but you I think

you get it so photons come with

polarization and that polarization in

principle can be rotated you can rotate

it by sending it through a quarter wave

plate or in any number of ways rays

[Music]

and that's photons it's the photon

theory of electromagnetism and in the

quantum theory one can think of the

Coulomb field as roughly speaking a

field set up by the emission and

absorption of photons emission and

absorption of these photons okay so

that's that's electrodynamics and a

nutshell electrons are charged protons

are charged and so forth and the and

they interact in this way with the gauge

field another aspect of gauge fields

I've already mentioned it that there's

always conservation laws associated with

them namely conservation of the sources

but conservation laws in both quantum

mechanics and classical mechanics are

always associated with symmetries

symmetries of some sort or another are

always behind conservation laws the

conservation of electric charge we've

talked about that and I showed you how

if you study the quantum mechanics of

electrons in terms of charged particles

in general there's a wave field

describing those particles this could be

the electron and the symmetry associated

with the conservation of charge is just

the multiplication of the field by a

phase so that was the simplest example

of a gauge theory a gauge charge meaning

the electric charge and a symmetry that

goes along with the conservation of that

charge those things go together okay

well let me just very quickly remind you

how it worked in quantum chromodynamics

in quantum chromodynamics a more

complicated structure you do have

maxwell like fields let's label them

the Maxwell like fields are labeled

by indices so in quantum quote let's

continue to call them AE there is no

universal symbol for the gauge field of

quantum chromodynamics sometimes it's

called G sometimes it's called a

sometimes it's called B sometimes it's

called C I'm going to call it a but in

order to distinguish it from the

electromagnetic field we give it some

indices I and J it's a matrix now it's a

matrix and that matrix transforms under

a group the group was su 3 so let me

just remind you very very quickly that

we started thinking about su 3 not by

thinking about gluons this is of course

would be the gluon field but by thinking

about quarks so a quark was an object

which we called q q could stand for the

quantum field of the quark and it has an

index the index that's not the up-down

index it's not the charm strange index

will come to that sooner or later it is

the color index red green or blue I

takes on three values and the symmetry

operation is not multiplying by e to the

I theta but multiplying by a unitary

special unitary matrix u IJ gives us Q

prime I that was the symmetry operation

which is a kind of rotation in a in a in

a kind of three-dimensional complex

space don't confuse it with ordinary

three-dimensional space

this was the symmetry operation and one

would say that the Q's think of them as

particles if you like the Q's form a

representation of su 3 which is called

the mental representation it's called

the fundamental representation it has

three entries red green and blue

sometimes it's called the defining

representation it's the smallest

non-trivial representation and it just

has just can be thought of as a three

component vector one two three and the

unitary matrices can be thought of as

matrices 3x3 matrices ok we've gone

through that the other thing that I told

you is that anti quarks or anti

particles in general are represented by

the complex conjugate fields field which

are simply the complex conjugates of the

original ones the relation the

mathematical relation between particle

and anti particle or the wave functions

of particles and antiparticles that

relationship is complex conjugation so

we could ask how do anti particles

transform well we simply realize that if

you want to transform the complex

conjugate field you should use the

complex conjugate matrix if you multiply

Q by you to get Q Prime then you must

multiply Q star by u star to get Q prime

star the set of matrices you are called

a representation of the group the set of

matrices u star are a distinct and

different representation in the group

and the language one would use is that

quarks and antiquarks are described by

the three-dimensional the

three-dimensional representation and we

could call a three star meaning complex

conjugate it's usually indicated by a

bar two different representations of SU

three

how many eight nine actually well sorry

you asked me how many matrices there are

the number of generators is eight yeah

because these matrices are assumed to be

special unitary matrices now you can ask

and it's interesting to ask what we're

kind of theory would you make if you

didn't insist that they be special and

I'll tell you another time maybe later

but they're but not now okay now what is

a IJ a IJ has two indices and the way to

think about it is that one of those it

is mathematically got the same group

theory structure the same symmetry

structure as having a quark J and an

antiquark

ie in other words this is an object

whose indices transform one index as the

three-dimensional representation and the

other index as the three-bar another way

to think about it is it has all of the

properties with respect to the symmetry

not with respect to all physical

properties but with respect to the way

it transforms it transforms as if it

were a quark and an antiquark sitting on

top of each other not at spin just its

color as if it were a quark and an

antiquark with one special rule namely

the trace of a IJ vanishes the singlet

singlet that you can make the piece

which has no transformation property

under the group at all that you can kill

and forget about that's why there are

eight AI J's instead of nine so a IJ is

like a thing with a quark and an

antiquark index but because it has a

quark and an antiquark index it also

transforms when you under the SU 3

transformation group in that sense it's

different than the

photon the photon is completely

electrically neutral it's filled the

photon field does not get a phase when

you rotate the electron wave function

electrons go to e to the I theta x

electrons positrons go to e to the minus

I theta x positrons photons do nothing

that's because they don't have electric

charge but the gluons they do have color

now what kind of color do they have they

have the color of a particle and an

antiparticle I say well particle and an

antiparticle shouldn't have any color

but they do because you could have a red

particle and a blue anti particle a red

that would make a thing which was not

really neutral which knew about color so

gluons do have color and they have color

in what is called the adjoint

representation which is the

representation of the eight generators

okay now what about what about the

interaction between quarks incidentally

are there are many other gauge theories

of interest they're all pretty similar

to each other the group might not be su3

it might be su - it might be su 4 it

might be su 10 it might be anything and

the objects of the group might not be

called quarks nevertheless or the

fundamental objects of the group the

analogs of quarks might be called

something else they might have a

different name R but they would be

objects which had a single index there

the anti objects would also have a

single index above the complex conjugate

kind and the analog of the gluons which

are called gauge bosons gauge bosons the

Maxwell like fields always have one

index of the

particle type and another index of the

anti particle type so that means let's

see if we call if we're talking about su

n that means how many generators

altogether well n times n is N squared

minus 1 for the trace so it's N squared

minus 1 distinct gluons now what is the

what is the connection between the

quarks or more generally or more

generally the particles which transform

like quarks perhaps in the more general

way what's the connection between them

and the gauge bosons and I've explained

that to you before but let me just

remind you again if you have a quark

labeled by I where I could be red green

or blue and another quark labeled by J

that the ithe quark can become the Jade

quark

if a gauge boson is emitted what kind of

gauge boson well as I showed you before

the way to think about it is just to

think about these lines running through

the diagram I runs right through so

that's I and J also runs right through

except when J is pointing downward it

should be thought of as the anti the

analog of an anti particle and so an I

would become a J by emitting a quanta a

quantum of the field a there's a ji or

IJ I think IJ

no ji doesn't matter very much by

emitting a gluon of the IJ type an eigth

article becomes a J particle and that is

one of the basic interactions of quantum

chromo of gauge theories in general of

gauge theories in general fundamental

objects analogous to quark

gauge bosons analogous to the gluons and

they rule about emission and absorption

that you have to follow the lines and

never lose and index but now that raises

something new if a gluon itself has the

properties of a quark and an antiquark

so let's say this is the I J DH kind of

glue on well the I J kind of glue on can

also emit a glue on how would it do it

the IJ glue on could become the i k f--

glue on i j let's say red green blue on

could become the red blue glow on as

long as the indices make sense and

they're followed anti k here alright so

this would be a interaction in which a

glue on of type IJ became a glue on of

type i k and a glue on they are glue on

of type K J glue one of type K J the

order of iron K matters or a KJ is not

the same as a JK but um are alright that

introduces something absolutely new

which is not in electrodynamics namely

that the gluons themselves are charged

particles and therefore exert forces on

each other they exert forces in a way

the photons do not exert forces on each

other the dynamics of gluons is much

much more complicated than the dynamics

of photons the last time what I told you

was that one of the and I'm not going to

do the mathematics of this it's not even

fully understood even now but the effect

one of the important effects is that if

you have a source a color a bit of color

with field lines coming out of it again

those field lines are not allowed to end

all right they're not allowed to end but

the effect let's suppose is a that's

quark is an anti quark over here field

lines have to come into it so the field

lines have to be continuous and so forth

I don't want we may not draw more than

that now the effect is that the field

lines interact with each other in a way

that they don't in electrodynamics and

the effect is very simple the field

lines get pulled into bundles which are

called flux tubes the result of which is

that no matter how far apart you pull

two quarks they'll never escape from

each other

because the energy stored in this gooey

piece of glue just increases linearly

with the distance between them all right

that's that's a summary of quantum

chromodynamics but it's also a summary

of gauge theory it's also a summary very

very quick summary of gauge theory

Maxwell like fields sources Gauss's law

making sure you have conservation and

symmetries symmetries having to do with

the conservation laws but more than that

the symmetries telling you how the

particles interact with each other in

terms of emission and absorption there

is one other thing and a gauge theory

and it's the coupling constant the

coupling constant is the analog of the

charge of the electron the charge of the

electron let's talk about what the

charge of the electron means it is of

course

coefficient in a finding diagram when

you emit a photon from a charged

particle the amplitude for that the

quantum mechanical amplitude for that is

the electric charge but if you wanted to

think about it operationally you can

imagine an electric charge slamming into

the of the cathode to the anode cathode

the cathode of a cathode ray tube when

it slams into it it gets accelerated and

the question is what is the probability

that an electron which is stopped

suddenly emits a photon okay the answer

is the square of the electric charge the

square roots really the square of the

electric charge there's some PI's in it

and H bars and things but but basically

the square of the electric charge in

suitable units R is the probability for

emitting a photon so that's what in

quantum mechanics and field theory that

is what the meaning of the electric

charge is it's a measure of the Prabhat

the square of the electric charge is the

probability Y because probabilities are

always squares of amplitudes but that's

the that's the fundamental significance

of the electric charge and the electric

charge is a dimensionless number just

the probability that when you stop an

electron you emit a photon so it's a

dimensionless number it's a small

dimensionless number in with appropriate

sets of definitions the square of the

electric charge really what tends to

come in two things is not quite the

square of the electric charge it's the

square of the electric charge divided by

some four pie for pies are always

floating around in there it's called the

fine-structure constant and the

fine-structure constant which is pretty

much the probability of a photon

emission is a number of about 1% it's

close to being 1 over 137 per famous

number 1 over 137 137 as

no particular significance it's just

numerically about what the

fine-structure constant is and let's

just call it 1% that says there's a 1%

probability of emitting a photon so if

you had a picture that when an electron

hits a cathode ray tube it sends out a

spray of photons that's not right what

is right is that if 137 photons hit the

cathode cathode ray tube on the average

one of them will give off a photon in

that sense electromagnetism is a weak

force or a weak process the probability

of emission is weak all right that

that's the quick summary of gauge theory

what I wanted to do is give you a very

very briefly a rundown on some numbers

and orders of magnitude in various parts

of particle and atomic physics and then

go on to the weak interactions now the

reason I'm giving you a rundown about

numbers is to show you how the weak

interactions quantum chromodynamics is

the theory of the strong interactions

whether the strong interactions was the

word before quantum chromodynamics was

invented for the interactions between

sub-nuclear particles between hadrian's

between protons neutrons mesons and all

the things which are made of quarks and

gluons

so it's theory of strong interactions

and there are electromagnetic

interactions and there are also weak

interactions so I want to spend a little

bit of time with numbers to show you

what where the terminology came from why

one is called weak why the one is called

strong why electromagnetism is sort of

in the middle between the two of them

but let's let's just review a couple of

numbers um first of all in terms of

Units energy distance and time do not

have to be

others different units they're all

related with each other first of all

time and distance really should not be

distinguished in any and sensible set of

units that are useful for fundamental

physics are we can set the speed of

light equal to one and if we do if we

fix the speed of light equal to one then

time and distance have the same units

and we can we can use the same units on

the as far as energy goes we could also

choose to set Planck's constant equal to

one that's a useful thing to do in

quantum mechanics or awful lot of

equations get simpler if you if you set

H bar equal to one

well they don't get a lot simpler they

just gets rid of the H bars but but you

can set H bar equal to one now let me

just remind you there's a connection

between energy e equals H frequency

right or H nu or H bar Omega all the

same thing the units of H bar well we've

set H bar equal to one so in units in

which H bar are equal to one energy is

equal to frequency but what's the units

of frequency one over time number of

oscillations per second so that means

that energy and time have inverse units

to each other you don't need to have a

separate unit for time and energy

anytime you have a unit of energy it

defines also a unit of time now of

course the unit of energy is inverse to

the unit of time so big energies

correspond to small time intervals and

okay so let's let's write down some

connections or and since energy and time

are connected to each other and time and

space have the same units when C is

equal to one then time and space have

units which are just inverse units to

the units of energy so for example

here's a unit of energy one electron

volt

we've used electron volts before one

electron volt cannot be thought of as a

unit of distance but the inverse one

inverse electron volt in other words one

over an electron one inverse electron

volt is a unit of distance and just to

have an idea of what it is it's about 10

to the minus seventh meters one electron

volt is about 10 to the minus seventh

meters so an electron volt is a fairly

small distance but on the scale of

fundamental physics it's not a small

distance 10 to the minus seventh meters

is what I think that oh i Adam is 10 to

the minus 10 meters something like that

yeah okay so it's it's fairly big an

atomic diameter yeah an atomic and we

can convert right and then atomic

diameter of one atom this is the atomic

diameter that's about 10 to the minus 10

meters and so you can convert that to

electron volts how many electron volts

is it or whatever it is an inverse of

about a thousand electron volts a Killah

electron volt an inverse Killah electron

volt is an atomic diameter okay

another fact just converting distance if

we know the distance of size of an atom

then we know the time that it takes

light to go across it all right so the

transit time is another quantity transit

time the time that it takes chance at

the time the time for light to cross an

atomic diameter what is that that's

about 10 to the minus 18 seconds I've

used the fact that light goes at about

10 to the 8th meters per second order of

magnitude 10 to the minus 18 seconds

these are just some numbers that I just

wrote down but a different time scale

all right so this is the time scale for

light to go across an atom the different

times and by an atom I don't mean the

nucleus I mean the the whole atom

another time scale is the time scale

that it takes for

the electron to orbit an atom now you

might think why isn't that just about

the transit time transit time is about

10 to the minus 18 centimeters the

reason is because electromagnetic forces

are fairly weak

because they are fairly weak the force

on and the ultimate reason that they're

weak is because this fine-structure

constant is alpha which is east east

squared over 4 pi that's a small number

of about 1 over 137 another way to say

it is the electromagnetic force on an

electron is weak because of that the

acceleration on the electron is not too

big and the orbit is fairly large the

weak of the force on an object the

larger the orbit is going to be sorry

the slower the electron will move is

what I meant to say the slower the

electron will move and because the

electron moves slowly by comparison with

the speed of light how much slower about

1 percent slower about this much slower

the electron moves around with only

about 1% to speed of light and that

means the orbital time orbital time

that's about 10 to the minus let's say

it's bigger that time is bigger 10 to

the minus 16 seconds another quantity

sometimes of interest is the decay time

for an atom how long does it take for an

atom an excited atom let's say a

hydrogen atom with its electron 1

orbital up from the ground state one

orbit up from the ground state how long

does it take to decay now

that is small EE small with 2 powers of

alpha what are the two powers of alpha

first of all the acceleration of the

electron is small remember the charges

emit radiation when they're accelerated

the acceleration is small

because the force is small so first of

all the acceleration is small the

electron moves around with a relatively

small acceleration compared to what it

could have been if alpha were bigger it

moves around with a small acceleration

but on top of that just like the

electron plowing into the cathode ray

tube there's another factor of alpha

when the electron is accelerated in the

probability that emits a photon so as

the electron goes around here first of

all it's moving with a slow acceleration

and second of all even that acceleration

is not very efficient in producing

photons just because the fine-structure

constant is small the net result is that

the time scale order of magnitude decay

time how long it takes for an atom to

decay decay time is about a nanosecond

10 to the minus 9 seconds much longer

than the orbital time or the transit

time so the main thing is is a variety

of different scales in the atom and

they're all related by the

fine-structure constant they're related

by powers of the fine-structure constant

the fine-structure constant being a

small number there are fairly large

ratios between different time scales

transit orbital and decay time all right

now let's come to hey groans hey drones

are like atoms they're atoms made up out

of quarks we could ask very much the

same kind of questions first of all we

could ask what is the hydronic diameter

the hydronic diameter of a typical

hadron it could be a proton Neutron

mizzen they're all more or less the same

as hydrants hydrants hydrants the

hydraulic diameter is a lot smaller than

the electron sorry then the atom it's a

lot smaller than the atom it's not 10 to

the minus 10 meters it's about 5 orders

of magnitude

smaller ten to the minus 15 centimeters

that's also more or less the diameter of

a nucleus nucleus of course being a few

protons and neutrons is going to be

bigger meters sorry meters Hadron

diameter is about 10 to the minus 15

meters five orders of magnitude smaller

than an atom part of the reason is

because part of these two reasons

there's two reasons why it's small one

of them has to do with the fact that the

constituents are heavier and heavier

things will sit closer to the to the

center the other has to do with

something else that we'll come to in a

minute but it's about five orders of

magnitude smaller the transit time the

transit time has just gotten from the

sides straight forwardly transit time

this is not an independent thing it's

just another measure of the size of the

thing just to get the numbers straight

it's 10 to the minus 23rd seconds so

that's a typical time scale for a well

it's for light to cross the Hadron okay

but now we can also talk about the

orbital motion of quarks how long does

it take for a court to swing around its

wavefunction or swing around the

interior of a proton and there the

answer is about 10 to the minus 23rd

seconds what about the decay time of a

typical hadron and a typical excited

state of a hadron a vibrating hadron or

an oscillating hadron how long does it

take for it to decay and the answer is

about now I'm talking about particular

kinds of decays a decay where you hit a

proton it starts oscillating and then

emits a Payan or

those decays have a lifetime of about

ten to the minus twenty third seconds

different than this hierarchy of scales

here what is the conclusion the

conclusion is the analog of the

fine-structure constant is much bigger

close to one for hydrants in other words

the emission probability if a quark

would get stopped in a fictitious

cathode-ray quark equal rate uber from

of cork flying off the probability for

it to emit a gluon would be about 1

that's what these things indicate here

the hierarchy here is entirely due to

the fine-structure constant the lack of

a hierarchy here can only mean that the

corresponding quantity in quantum

chromodynamics must be close to 1 by now

it's been measured in many ways and it

is much closer to 1 it's much larger

than the the corresponding quantity for

electrodynamics one of the little it is

seen that just special relativity say

passed would be

23 sets of cupcakes like yeah I think

that's a fair statement

yeah it's about as fast as it could be

in other words it's about as fast as it

could be nothing slowing it down this is

why the strong interactions are called

strong now the facts about the numbers

here were known before quantum

chromodynamics and it was understood

that there was no hierarchy of scales

and that's why it was called strong

interactions we now trace it to the

properties of the charge or the

fine-structure constant incidentally for

quantum chromodynamics the analogous

quantity is not really one it's about a

fifth but much bigger than the 1 over

137 here all right so that's that was

just some numbers and some facts about

this there's a bunch of she comes

together to talk about the story so

[Music]

let's go out for QCD okay so this is

called alpha and the other one is called

alpha QCD that's about 0.2 3 or

something like that or you can text to

pay for me right after you learn in

context of paper me write alpha

I never heard Alfa QED referred to as

alpha QED but I think if you were

writing a paper with both of them you

might call the top one alpha QED yes

I've never seen it particularly well I

can't I don't think I've ever seen it

oh oh it's just called alpha sometimes

unshielded one is called the bear alpha

the shielded one is called the

renormalized alpha right okay well that

brings us to the weak interactions weak

interactions are called

weak primarily because the decay times

associated with them are very long

they're much longer than the decay times

associated with with either hadrian's

and they're even they even tend to be

longer than the decay times associated

with atoms so there are processes in

nature decay processes in nature in

which particles elementary or otherwise

decay by weak interactions where the

timescale in other words the half-life

for these decays is far longer than any

scale that can be accounted for by these

by numbers like this so as an example

here's some examples well the lifetime

of the Neutron Neutron is a hey guard

laughs decays neutron goes to electron

proton plus anti neutrino and the

lifetime for that is about 12 minutes

that's absurdly long on particle physics

scales part of the reason is easy but it

hardly accounts for the for the

extraordinary stability of the neutron

part of the reason is the neutron is

only a little bit bigger than the

combined masses of the electron the

proton and the neutron neutrino let's

just uh see somebody how about their

pocket calculator the mass of the

neutron is 940 MeV

I don't 940 about 940 the mass of the

proton is about 939 I think the actual

difference between them is about one and

a half MeV but then there's the electron

which has a mass of about half an MeV

altogether out of this 940 almost a

thousand MeV the difference of mass of

the proton the amount of available mass

left over is tiny as 0.1 percent or less

if the neutron was slightly lighter than

the sum of these masses it could not

decay at all just energy conservation

would not allow it remember masses

energy it would not have enough energy

to decay and still leave over some

energy for kinetic energy of these

particles so if the neutron was exactly

the same as the sum of the energy of the

electron the proton a neutrino the sum

of the mass of them

it wouldn't be able to decay at all if

you gave it a mass tiny tiny tiny tiny

bit above that it would be able to decay

but it would take a very long time that

the K would be very slow so part of the

slowness or the long lifetime of the

neutron is attributable to the fact that

there's very little energy available for

the decay to take place but given that

that's hardly the bulk of the story 12

minutes is so absurdly long long that

there's something much much more than

that going on another example let's see

what do I have it I guess I didn't write

it down another example of this is

called a weak decay for obvious reasons

it's called a weak decay another example

is a charged PI on let's say a PI minus

a charged PI on decays to an electron

electron has negative charge and an anti

neutrino are yes and an anti-neutrino

that's another possible decay charge pi

on goes to an electron and antineutrino

a positively charged PI on could become

a positron and a neutrino the life time

for that I believe is about 10

nanoseconds longer than these atomic

decay times and atomic decay times are

very very long by comparison with

particle physics decay times now this

there is a decay of the charge pawns

through these particles is another decay

involving nuan's we're going to come to

muon soon enough similar to electrons

but the point is not the particles that

they decay into but two things first of

all they also decay very

slowly nanoseconds but there's plenty of

energy available for these theta decays

these the case I'm not suppressed by the

fact that the energies of the initial

and all the masses of the initial and

final states are very close to each

other so there's something else going on

are in weak interactions whatever we can

whatever weak interactions are there's

something that makes them proceed very

very slowly and weakly all right so

that's what we come to next is weak

interactions are the primary or oldest

example of which is the decay of the

neutron the beta decay of the neutron

called beta because electrons are

originally called beta waves

all right that's and this is called the

beta decay of the PI arm and in fact

it's quite similar quite similar physics

goes into both of them so to understand

what's going on we need to understand

about some more particles particles that

we haven't come to yet the leptons

let's go back to the quarks for a moment

and let me just make a table of the

different kinds of quarks horizontally

or make a sequence here which will be

red blue and green these are the colors

of quarks then along here let me list

the up quark the down quark the charm

quark the strange quark the top quark

and the bottom quark they're each one of

these boxes is filled there are red blue

and green up quarks let's put an X there

there's an X here there's an X here

there's an X here X here X here and so

forth these X's represent all the

possible quarks that exist now quantum

chromodynamics has to do with symmetries

which connect red to green to blue has

to do with these unitary transformations

which mix up the colors of quarks they

do not those symmetries do not mix

horizontally and su 2 su 3 symmetry a

color symmetry may rotate an up red

quark into an up blue quark or an up

green quark and the nature of the

symmetry is to act vertically to mix up

things this way this way it also at the

same time will mix the different down

quarks the different colors of down

quarks the same symmetry will mix the

different colors of charm quarks and

strange quarks and so forth so the color

symmetry acts vertically it mixes up the

different rows here

yes the unitary matrices mix up red

green and blue I might have done better

to put the rows where the columns are in

the columns with a rose R but no it's

okay it's good it's good no no it's good

that's good right the weak interactions

are associated with symmetries which act

horizontally in this picture they mix up

with down they mix at the same time that

they mix up with down they mix charm

with strange and they mix top with

bottom let me just remind you that an up

quark has the same properties apart for

its mass same properties as a charm

quark or a top quark the down quarks are

similar to strange quarks and bottom

quarks ups have charged 2/3 downs have

charged minus 2/3 same here and here on

so these are symmetries which mix if you

like upness with down this at the same

time charm this with strangeness and top

this with bottomless mixes these up the

symmetries those symmetries

what would you care to speculate on what

group might be involved a su 2 because

it acts on things on doublets we simply

have three doublets here and never they

don't take up the charm or up to top

they simply act on up and down

horizontally among pairs of things a

group su 2 and it is a gauge symmetry in

other words it is also comes together

with forces with gauge bosons with

interactions and with gauge interaction

or gauge fields we're going to get to

those short enough but we've left out

something from this table here it's kind

of as if there was a fourth color now

the reason the fourth row here is not

usually identified as a color

and the reason is because the particles

do not interact with the gluons but

nevertheless it is another row here

another row in which there are particles

which are filled in here and in a

certain sense there or not in a certain

sense they are also doublets these

particles are also doublets and also get

mixed up under this su 2 symmetry which

moves things horizontally what are they

what are those particles they're the

leptons so in a sense the fourth color

could be thought of as lepton number but

what are the leptons the leptons are

first of all in the first column here

there are analogous to the upload

analogous to the down there is the

electron the electron is a lepton but

its partner its partner is the neutrino

but there are different neutrinos

there's not only one neutrino this is

called the electron neutrino what comes

in the next column muon the muon in

every respect except for mass is the

same as an electron just as in every

respect except for mass the charm quark

is like an up quark or the strange quark

is like a down quark and together with

it there's its own neutrino the muon

neutrino and finally the last one is

called the tau and nu sub tau all of the

charged leptons incidentally neutrinos

of course as you might guess from their

name are electrically neutral the

electrons muons and Tau's have charged -

warn okay they put they are put under

the down column here not because their

charge is the same

the down charge but because the

difference between the charges of the

two is the same as the charge difference

up here what's the difference between

the charge of an up and a down

two-thirds minus minus one-third so the

difference between this column and this

column is plus one unit of charge the

difference between this column in this

column is also one unit of charge one

sorry zero minus negative one so as you

go from here to here you decrease charge

by one unit as you go horizontally now

should we take a break for five minutes

let's take a break for five minutes and

then I will tell you about the W bosons

W bosons are the gauge bosons of the

weak interactions all right so let's say

let's try now to see if we can make a

microscopic gauge theory of the weak

interactions ah ah as I said the weak

interactions are based on a gauge theory

which mixes up to down the tree no two

electron and so forth and so rather than

to get into mathematics for the moment

the mathematics of the group su 2 which

will come back to let's think a little

more simply we've seen that in various

situations the gauge bosons typically

have the quantum numbers or the quantum

properties of a particle and an anti

particle in the case of the

[Music]

in the case of the quantum

chromodynamics it is a quark and an

antiquark so that's why we had nine

gauge bosons and so forth or eight

removing the trace so we could we could

start by saying let's look at the

possibilities of gauge bosons which have

the properties of of a particle and the

antiparticle but it let's not

distinguish between whether we're

talking about quarks red quarks blue

quarks green quarks or leptons let's

just say a particle from this column

with an anti particle of this column and

for simplicity let's just focus on the

leptons you'll see in a moment that you

get the same thing if you focused on the

quarks but let's focus on the leptons

and talk about objects that we could

make with a lepton and an anti lepton

alright first of all we could have some

simple things electron with a positron

now I don't really literally mean

electrons and positrons okay

we could have electrons and positrons

electrons and positrons have no charge

at all so let's drop that for a minute

we'll come back to it there are things

which have properties of electrons and

anti electrons neutrinos and

antineutrinos

but more interesting for the moment is

the combination of electron antineutrino

so what is the charge of an object which

has the the consumed conserved

quantities the same properties as an

electron with stuck on top of an anti

neutrino well let's just focus on its

charge its electric charge its electric

charge is minus 1 neutrino is neutral

electron electron has negative charge so

whatever this object is

it has negative electric charge let's

give it a name and let's call it a gauge

boson let's assume that it is also a

gauge boson gauge boson means that it

behaves like the Maxwell field the whole

same thing but it has negative charge

what's called W W that's the traditional

name for it W - why - because it has

negative electric charge we could that

was there was this one with this one we

could have taken down quark with it I

guess

anti up quark yeah down quark what

happens if you take down quark with anti

up quark I'm as charged do you get again

- same as this down quark with anti up

quark would also have - charge so if you

like you could also imagine that the W -

has the same properties as a down quark

and an anti up quark in other words it's

one from the second column and anti one

from the first column that's the

property that it has let's call it W for

week in fact I think W is originally the

notation for week the negatively charged

W boson and of course there's also a

positively charged boson W boson which

is like anti down with an up or like

positron u plus with a neutrino a plus

with a neutrino would be a W plus let's

suppose the pattern is pretty similar to

quantum chromodynamics that the W bosons

are like either photons on the one hand

or like gluons which means that they

would be objects which could be emitted

from

the leptons there would be objects which

will allow a lepton of one kind

let me not label it a lepton of one kind

to become a lepton of another kind by

emitting a W boson let's see if we can

find some examples are an electron can

emit a W - to become ametrine o electron

becomes neutrino by emission of a w -

you see the action of the gauge bosons

is to do the same kind of transition

that the symmetry is ultimately going to

be imagined to do to mix electron into

neutrino in very much the same way that

the colors got mixed by emitting gluons

you could follow the lines if you like

and say the electron and the anti

neutrino over here can be imagined to be

a w- boson same pattern let's just draw

it by saying a w- is emitted but that's

not all you can do with the w- you can

also have a Down quark go to an up quark

with a w- that also works and in fact

the w- is an object which can be emitted

in a transition from let's see from the

right column to the left column a red

down quark can become a red up quark by

emitting a w blue down quark can become

a blue up quark by emitting a w likewise

for green but you can go further the

strange quark not the strange quark the

yeah the strange quark can become a

charmed quark that's another one strange

quark charmed quark again w- so this new

symmetry this is an idea of a new

symmetry or jacked horizontally and only

horizontally between neighboring pairs

here introduces the possibility of gauge

bosons which cause transitions between

electron neutrino down quark and up

quark strange quark and charm quark now

a w+ + w- our anti particles of each

other

the meaning of that is that you can flip

these diagrams put the W - down W here

but when you flip it it becomes a w+ so

a w+ can be absorbed by an electron plus

a unit of charge - the unit of charge to

become a neutrino so a whole family of

different processes are codified by this

one vertex here we can turn them upside

down neutrino goes to you know you know

we're allowed to do we've done this

things before and that's the basic new

element of the weak interactions

actually that's all young

it's not clear to me why you have a w-

in all three of these cases there's

electric charge conservation couldn't be

w+ when you accept i don't know what is

w means w is the name of a particle it's

the name of another gauge be out of the

charge the charge conservation doesn't

it's could be - right

but well I haven't seen any reason why

it should be the same part of it or well

okay that that that's right but what it

comes down to in the end is an empirical

fact it's the empirical fact that the

symmetry of the weak interactions acts

simultaneously on all of these doublets

here when an up goes to a down a charm

has to go to a strange a towel has to go

to a top has to go to a bottom and the

leptons have to mix with each other

simultaneously the implication of that

the implication of that from a practical

point of view is simply it's the same

symmetry which acts it's the same gauge

bosons which are which are there you

could have imagined a theory in which

it's quite mathematically consistent to

imagine a theory where different W type

bosons would have a bit been emitted by

up quarks charm quarks or tau quarks or

even leptons right it's a fact of nature

a fact of nature that nature is simpler

than might have been ah that the same

gauge bosons cause transitions between

any row any point row you know what I

mean I'm going to get tongue-tied if I

try to say it okay well first of all how

do we what what processes can we explain

present yeah can he can

[Music]

and negative associated oh yes yes yes

yes you can flip arrows and you can flip

lines yes yes certainly you can flip the

arrows yeah absolutely absolutely and

you can also flip lines up and down in

various ways for example another way you

could flip the line is you could take

this up quark here have it instead of

going out instead of an up quark going

out an anti up quark comes in whenever

you flip a line from past to future or

from future to past you'll also change

from particle to anti particle

brightness library another Knights there

is strange in part wrong

yes so that's the same as a down in time

oh yeah grateful 30 yeah that's a

strange in part wrong it's not literally

a strange and an anti charm it's just a

rule that tells you that whatever these

W bosons are they're associated with

transitions from one column to the other

did I sorry strange all right electron

to neutrino strange to charm is that

wrong

who said it was an anti charm all right

if you follow the lines like that at the

point where the line turns around it has

to be thought of as an anti particle

right okay or if you like you can always

think of it as strange anti charm coming

in and making a W boson okay just keep

in mind whenever you flip from the past

to the future if you want to know what a

W boson will decay to let's read it that

downward it will decay to a strange and

an anti charm and that really can happen

yeah so we create a W boson from like

electron and a neutrino anti and

neutrino and then call the W boson to

change into like a train get a charm

exactly that's where some of these

processes are going to come from now so

let's let's think about the various

processes let's start just for fun let's

start with the decay of the pie - what

is it by - a pie - is a quark and an

antiquark with altogether negative

charge so let's say a quark and an

antiquark with negative charge had

better be that here's the pie - that's

equal to

a down quark and an antiquark down and

anti up now what kind of down an anti up

do let's see if we can find down an anti

up here here it is right here down and

anti up can become a w- that's a

possible transition ah that is allowed

by the physics of w bosons so here's a

w- but now a w- can do something else

a w- here is let's say here is a w+

let's put w+ upstairs here sorry this is

w- now and let's put the neutrino

downstairs anti neutrino and read this

as saying that w- goes to what electron

antineutrino so w- can go to electron

antineutrino and here it is e - ordinary

electron so that's the basic underlying

process that governs the beta decay of

the negatively charged pi on into a into

a electron and an anti-neutrino now

which anti neutrino is it there are

three distinct anti neutrinos it's the

electron antineutrino over here so it's

the electron antineutrino

but it can also I didn't draw all the

various possibilities but any place you

saw an electron you can put a muon

anyplace and as long as you carry along

the muon neutrino so another process is

muon

and I'm you on the tree no and just for

clarity this is not strictly a Fineman

diagram right this is just showing an

interaction it's pretty close to a fine

well except for the time direction oh

yeah okay antenna I don't know why all

of a sudden I change directions yeah for

some reason yeah right time is the time

is now going horizontally I've become a

computer scientist and they they

measured their yeah yeah they do

right yeah it's pretty much yeah let's

good we turn it up I can't do that

easily but yeah yeah that is essentially

a Fineman diagram describing the decay

of the pie - too demure as it happens

the for technical reasons having to do

with some complications and Fineman

diagrams that are not interesting to us

as it happens the primary decay or

primary I mean the most probable the

most probable decay of the pie - is to

the muon antineutrino not to the

electron antineutrino it's a technical

point of no no special interest to us it

just happens to be that way

will it be consistent instead of peace

considering these moment diagrams with

with the time deal is more like a

chemical equilibrium deal which way

you're going well both things can happen

both things gamma is not there so but

not in chemical equilibrium we're in

empty space when empty space except

somebody made a pie - a pie - was

created how a pie - might be created by

some nucleons coming together and

creating by strong interactions by

strong interactions of pie - might be

created now that pie - is just going

along and saying wait a minute I can

decay if I like into a neutrino and a

muon then of course the neutrino and the

muon have enough energy kinetic energy

to fly off and they won't come back

together again because they've departed

they've gone away okay on the other hand

it is true that if you were to take a

muon and an anti-neutrino and fire them

toward each other there would be a

probability that they would make up I -

so yes you can read it both ways let's

go like in one dimension you have a su 3

the other su 2 is it possible if you

like combine them into an issue six or

something this your 5 su 5 that's your

five not two times three two plus three

you know all right

su five but not tonight tonight we want

to get to su two that we'll all be happy

if we get the basic ideas of su 2 all

right now keep in mind we're doing

something a little bit funny because we

have su two has how many generators

three so how many gauge bosons should it

have three so fall we only have W + + W

- there must be another one looking

around and that other one must be

associated somehow was something like

electron anti electron and neutrino anti

neutrino but we'll come through it just

like the Yahoo will come through it

there is a third gauge boson lurking

around and it does play a big role in

the weak interactions but it didn't play

a big role historically in the weak

interactions just because for reasons

we'll come to historically it was the W

boson which was the first to be

conjectured nothing but speaking of

historically was the weak or the strong

force sort of suspected first

oh of course all right so let's talk

about the history the history of these

forces goes back to Becker L goes back

to radioactivity alpha beta and gamma

decay alpha decay was what a mission of

a two protons and two neutrons from a

nucleus that's a strong interaction it's

part of the theory of hadrons in nuclei

beta decay that was this one right here

weak interactions and gamma decay photon

so historically they happened at the

same time in the same experiment

the energy conservation how it works are

you assuming some kinetic okay um yeah

the energy card let's recover you never

worry about the energy conservation in

intermediate states like this if the

energy of the intermediate state doesn't

match the energies of the initial and

final state it just means that the

intermediate state can only last for a

very short time there's an energy time

uncertainty principle you can violate

the energies in a Fineman diagram for

short periods of time so don't worry

about conservation of energy between

here and here the only energy we have to

worry about is the initial energy in the

final energy okay so let's worry about

it

a Payan has an energy of about a mass

let's suppose the Payan is at rest the

mass of the Payan is roughly about a

hundred and forty MeV all right what is

the energy of the of the muon and the

neutrino well first of all it's the rest

energy of the muon and then the Trino

okay and the rest energy the rest mass

of them the mass of the neutrino sorry

the mass of the muon I think is about a

hundred MeV I forget exactly and the

mass of a neutrino is for practical

purposes zero too small to be important

yeah so there's more energy to start

with than the energy in the in the

masses of the two final particles does

that mean it can't happen no it just

means that the particles will go off and

carry some kinetic energy so the

difference between the energy on this

side and the sums of the masses on this

side is just the kinetic energy of the

outgoing particles that's the energy

balance the momentum also has to be

conserved and that means if the Payan

was at rest to begin with the momentum

of the muon and the momentum of the

neutrino have to be equal and opposite

and they'll go out back-to-back so to

speak if you analyze the neutron you can

say I'm going to do that now yeah let's

do the neutron decay right now see how

Neutron works oh let's do something

simpler first let's do the muon decay

the muon is also something that can

decay so let's take the muon here's the

muon moving along now what can the muon

do the muon can become a neutrino sub

muon and emit a W what kind of w w -

right become a W - and a neutrino okay

but now one of the things that W - can

do is it can become an electron and an

anti-neutrino so this w - can now become

an electron and an anti-neutrino of the

electron variety can this happen the

only thing that would press it can

happen not only can happen this is the

way the muon decays are the muon decays

because it is sufficiently much heavier

than the electron much heavier than the

electron about 200 times heavier than

the electron the neutrinos are

practically massless so the energy

balance is you have about 100 MeV here a

half an MeV here and the rest goes off

in kinetic energy so that's an example

of a what's called a purely lepton ik

process no quarks in it at all

yeah so it's one neutrino one anti

neutrino and an electron okay so that

happens and that's the primary the

primary decay it's the only decay of the

muon so the muon is an unstable particle

because of this but the reason the muon

is unstable and not the electron is just

the muon happens to be heavy enough to

be able to decay to the electron the

electron is not heavy enough to decay to

the muon so in a sense it's an accident

of the masses the same is true of the

Tau incidentally the Tau can also decay

to two other leptons but all right

that's the mew decay and notice the

components are the same the basic

components are the same a transition

from one column to another followed by a

w and then the W makes another

transition from one column to the other

or if you like a decay from one column

to the other all right what about the

the decay of the neutron decay of the

neutron would it be consistent to say

the purpose of the linear accelerators

per se is to effectively increase the

mass of the electron so that it can now

go the other direction absolutely yeah

you know changing ass you just put man

but nothing absolutely yeah but that's

exactly right

okay we were going to do Neutron decay

so the neutron is maybe I better switch

to vertical don't want a vertical

vertical notation back to vertical

Neutron is three quarks two down quarks

and an up quark write my minus 4/3 plus

2/3 sorry minus 2/3 yes that's a neutron

electrically neutral neutral neutrons

coming in ok now what is possible first

of all we can have the up quark become a

down quark and emit some sort of W but

that will give us three down quarks

three down quarks is a fine thing

there's nothing wrong with three down

quarks except that the mass of three

down quarks of the L of a particle with

three down quarks is always too heavy

for the neutron to decay so that's not

what happens what about one of the down

quarks the down quark can emit a W

become an up quark this is again a W

minus the down quark emits of W minus

becomes an up quark and now we have two

up quarks and a down quark up up down

where's that called that's a proton at

the W core the W does what the W always

does it can decay it decays to an

electron and an anti-neutrino electron

antineutrino so that's the that's the

beta decay of the neutron could it decay

into a muon and a neutrino not enough

energy the muon is too heavy so that

there wouldn't be enough energy left

over

or for the muon but other than that if

it were not for that it could happen

another way to say it is if you could

jam some more energy into the neutron

how can you do it you hit it you give it

a shove you give the neutron a whack you

excite it and if you're excited enough

it can decay to a proton a neutrino anti

neutrino and a muon but without somehow

providing that extra energy the neutron

will only decay to the proton electron

and antineutrino okay now let's come

let's see where are we I think we're

finished for tonight I think we'll

finish for that but remember we have a

puzzle and the puzzle is why is it that

the weak interactions give such slow

decay rates and I can think of one

reason namely the coupling constant or

the analog of the of the fine-structure

constant could be ridiculously small so

that the probability of emitting these W

bosons would be very very small that is

not the reason the fine-structure

constant for the weak interactions is

about the same for electromagnetism that

is not the reason the reason is

something else and we'll come to

something else next time

Lagrangian the Lagrangian is invariant

under those operations that's exactly

what it means I didn't want to start

writing bunches of lagrangian's so I've

used the shorthand of saying as a

symmetry right but that's what it means
