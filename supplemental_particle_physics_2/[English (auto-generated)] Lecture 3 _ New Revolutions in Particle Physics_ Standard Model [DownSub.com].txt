alright let's um talk about rotations of

space in this language rotations of

space are a symmetry and they can act on

various things but one of the things

they can act on is vectors those vectors

might be a vector field or they might

just be some some vector in space

velocity vector whatever rotations act

on vectors and they rotate vectors from

one vector to another no to put this up

rotations can be combined you can take

an object rotate it about an axis by a

certain angle and then rotate it by

another axis about an angle and the

result is an overall rotation about some

other axis by some other angle so in an

abstract sense are the rotations do form

a group let's just think about it for a

minute the rotation operations have a

group structure imagine taking a set of

coordinates incidentally how do we

parameterize rotations rotations can be

parameterized as vectors all right we

won't worry about the fact that rotating

by more than for the moment by more than

2pi brings you back to this and

supposing you don't worry about that for

a moment rotations can be first of all

they have an axis their rotations about

an axis let's take all rotations to

always be right-handed in other words

rotations right-handed what happens if

we have a rotation which is left-handed

we can either think of it as a rotation

a right-handed rotation by negative

angle or we can think of it as a

right-handed rotation by the opposite

axis doesn't matter you get the same

thing all right so rotation has an axis

let's call that a unit vector

n

and it has an angle that you rotate by

theta how many parameters does it take

to describe an angle a unit vector takes

two parameters to describe a unit vector

longitude and latitude on the sphere

unit vector is an arrow pointing them

into a unit sphere so that's two angles

and another angle for how much you

rotate about that's three angles or

three parameters to describe a rotation

it's a three parameter family of objects

now when you rotate an object if you

rotate an object a rigid object imagine

you have a rigid object and you rotate

it about some axis and then you rotate

it about some other axis the result is

always equivalent to a rotation by yet

some other axis and some other angle so

the product of two rotations one that

done sequentially one and then another

is always another rotation so the answer

is yes there is a product structure two

rotations number one there is an

identity operation for rotations just no

rotation at all there is an inverse any

rotation about any axis the inverse of

it is just the rotation by the opposite

angle about the same axis or you can if

you like think of it the same rotation

about the opposite axis but that's not

going to do it this over for any real

tation about any axis there's always

exactly the opposite one which undoes it

so there's an inverse structure sorry

there's a yaw there's an inverse

structure what else do we need for a

group it is and it also happens to be

associative yeah it happens to be

associative that that's a true fad it's

not quite as obvious

okay so rotations are a group have we

failed to say anything about rotations

oh good it's none abelian this is the

fact that a rotation about the x axis

followed by a rotation about the y axis

is

not the same as interchanging the two

orders of rotation go home and do that

if you haven't done it before rotate

about the x axis then the y axis and

then do it the opposite order you won't

get back to the same thing the smaller

rotations are the closer it is to being

a bit less fingers sequential rotations

not simultaneous

no no sequential one after another yeah

group action is always corresponds to

sequence sequential right that is

correct the car the smaller the

rotations in a certain sense the the

closer it is to commuting but the group

is definitely a non commutative or a non

abelian group it's our first non abelian

group let's talk about its

representations where we're going

incidentally is if we get to it tonight

is the study of color color is a

symmetry group and it's represented as a

symmetry the color of I'm talking now

not about the the color of the your

shirt I'm talking about the color of

quarks the red green and blue it's not

up and down it's not a two-state system

it's a three state system and the

operations which which are interesting

are the ones which mix up the different

colors of works and but so much of

physics has that pattern of group

symmetries that we need to understand

that before we go on okay arm rotations

rotations how do we construct a

representation a matrix representation

of rotations and the easiest way to do

it is to take the components of a vector

let the basic objects be the components

of an ordinary vector call a vector V

and it has components V XY and Z or VI

let's call them VI I can equal 1 2 & 3

or X Y and

and so forth now when you rotate either

you can either think of rotating the

axes or rotating physically the vector

about some direction of course the

components VX and V Y and VZ change and

they change by being multiplied by a

rotation matrix alright so for every

rotation about any angle about any axis

there is a rotation matrix the rotation

matrix depends on the angle of rotation

and the axis and it is a matrix IJ how

do you find the new resulting set of

components you multiply the matrix by VJ

and you get let's call it V Prime I

again summed over J this is matrix times

vector gives transformed vector alright

that's where these are rotation matrices

now as you know the definite you know

the the properties of rotation matrices

I believe we've gone through them but I

will go through them again hmm invariant

length yeah let's just see what that

says yeah let's let's work out the

properties of rotation matrices this is

another group of course another group

and another representation this is a

three-dimensional representation of the

rotation group there is not the only

representation of the rotation group

there's many of them but this is the

three-dimensional 3 by 3 matrix

representation the rotation group and

it's easy to think about because you can

just visualize it in terms of the

components of a 3 vector of a spatial

vector alright arm

fr rotates V and gives V Prime and R is

truly a rotation of the vector then it

doesn't change the length of the vector

that's the property of a rotation it

changes

nobody's length incidentally we take the

components of the vector to be real

numbers for the moment real numbers and

the matrices are are also composed out

of real elements so what is the

condition the condition is the condition

for this to be a rotation is that for

every possible V and V prime V prime

being the result of rotation that VI VI

this means the sum VX square plus dy

squared plus V Z squared

the length the square of the length of V

should be the same as the square of the

length of V Prime let's work that out

let's see what that says we can work

that out in detail this is our I J let's

let's put V J here it doesn't matter

with something it doesn't matter what we

call it V J same thing okay

our I J V J is equal to V prime I right

oh I don't know maybe it's maybe I want

that I here doesn't matter this is V

prime I right let's write the same

equation again our I K V K equals V

prime I I've changed I you never this

dummy index the summation index I don't

want to conflate with this one here but

this one is the same as this one now

what I want to do is I want to form V

prime I V prime I so I want to multiply

this by this and sum over I and what

will I get I will get V prime I V prime

I equals R IJ v j RI k VK with every

repeated index summed over

or equivalently just write a little

differently rij RI k VJ VK this should

be the same as what this should be the

same as VI VI that's this over here is

equal to this over here

what is the condition that this is equal

to this for every possible V right

alright let's write it in two steps ah

it is that our i j r i k is equal to

delta j k in other words if this were

true that r IJ RI k summed over i was

the chronica delta then it would tell

you to set J equal to K and this would

just become V squared so that's the

condition for a rotation matrix and it

can be written in a different way it can

be written that that the transpose R

times transpose is equal to 1 this is

the unit operator and this is the

representation for R times its transpose

so a rotation matrix satisfies let's

right over here that our transpose times

R is equal to 1 does everybody remember

transposes transpose is just

interchanging rows and columns our

transpose r is equal to 1 now actually

we immediately now know what the inverse

of any rotation matrix is it's just the

transpose the rotation group has this

property that then that's base that's

basically it's defining property our

tramper that's the defining property of

the matrices of rotation matrices if you

construct for every rotation such a

matrix and you multiply the matrices

we'll find they wrote the the matrix

representation of the multiplication

table of our vocations I'm just doing

this as an example are so there are

three by three representations

three-dimensional representations of the

rotation group can we think of the

three-dimensional representations of the

rotation group as in any way being

related to the quantum states of

something

well we studied spin spin describes the

angular momentum of a particle and so

forth and you can rotate the spin of a

particle you can take a particle and you

can rotate it you can put it in a

magnetic field

rotate the magnetic field and it'll mix

up the states it'll mix up the states ah

we discovered that there were various

angular momentum possibilities for the

spin that was spin 1/2 spin one spin

three-halves was also spin zero zero

spin 1/2 spin 1 how many states does a

spin one particle have 3 what happens

when you take the state of a spoon what

does that mean that means that a spin

one particle just the spin of it nothing

but the spin of it can be described by a

column vector with three entries

representing the amplitude for any one

of the three states of the spin suppose

you want to rotate that spinner well to

rotate that spin you must multiply it by

some kind of rotation sort of operator

that rotates it rotate to rotate the

spin state it's got three states the

rotation matrices are the rotation

operators which act on the state vector

the mix of the components must also be a

three-dimensional representation of the

rotation group in fact it's just that

wrote instance to step

so it's often one speaks about spin one

particles being vector particles what

that means is that the three states can

be thought of as being in one-to-one

correspondence with the three components

of a vector and they mix up among

themselves the same way as the

components of the quantum states of a

spin one particle all right but but I

want to I'm interested now in a spin 1/2

particle well I have a spin 1/2 particle

and I want to know how the state do it

anybody want to take a rest let's take a

little rest yeah we've gone through a

lot of material I've tried to keep it as

simple as I possibly can incidentally

we've encountered two different kinds of

groups are discrete groups and

continuous groups the group of composed

of 1 & P has only two elements only two

elements to the group and it's sort of

discrete you can either flip or not flip

the troller is the rotation group or the

multiplication by e to the I Phi is

continuous Phi can be a continuous

variable so there's a continuous

infinity of elements and of course in

the rotation group there are also a

continuous infinity of elements so the

kind of transformations and the kind of

symmetries that we can think about in

physics break up into two kinds the

discrete symmetries and the continuous

symmetries rotation being a continuous

symmetry reflection being a discrete

symmetry the groups that are associated

with continuous symmetries are usually

called lis groups l REE they were first

studied in mathematics by Prada by a

mathematician named Li with Li Yi German

mathematician and I guess in the 19th

century

[Music]

right our interest will mainly be in

continuous groups well go now and then

we might think of a discrete group okay

um where were we

yeah I said that for a spin one particle

which has three states the mathematics

of rotating around those states is just

the mathematics of the three-dimensional

representation of the rotation group but

then you can ask what about spin 1/2

particles well first of all what about

spin zero particles what happens to a

spin spin zero when you rotate it

nothing there's all that so the the

symmetry group as applied to a spin zero

particle the rotation group really only

has one element that it's the unit

element and nothing else and it's

representation it's just completely

represented by nothing more than the

unit operator it's a completely trivial

system that's been 0 particle the spin

1/2 particle also already has 2 States

now given a state of the spin 1/2

particle heavily what does it mean to be

given a state it means

one-zero that's to be identified with up

and 0/1 is to be identified with down

and a general quantum state as a complex

number here let's call it alpha 1 and

alpha 2 two complex numbers what do we

specify about them we specify nothing

more than that the sums of the squared

magnitude of them alpha 1 star alpha 1

plus alpha 2 star alpha 2 should be

equal to 1 that's all other than that

it's free to through to choose alpha 1

and alpha 2 if we choose alpha 1 equal 1

and alpha 2 equal to zero then we are

talking about a spin pointing in the up

direction now up of course is relative

to some definition of an axis but let's

pick our axis vertical z axis then this

state represents an up spin this state

represents a down spin and in general

this combination here represents a spin

state in some direction spin oriented in

some direction which is determined by

alpha 1 and alpha 2 now we're not going

to do the algebra figuring all that out

but we can ask what if we take a given

spin state alpha 1 and alpha 2 and we

rotate it we or do we just rotate our

coordinates or we physically rotate all

the spin States right we physically

rotate the spin to another axis or just

whatever this is whatever the

configuration was we rotate it what do

we get well we have to operate on this

to get something new alpha 1 prime alpha

2 prime what do we operate on States to

get new States we operate with operators

or with matrices again

matrices in the matrix representation so

this is going to be some element let's

call it u u 1 1 u 1 2 u 2 1 u 2 2 every

rotation can be represented as a 2 by 2

matrix acting on spinners on half spin

states let's see what the properties of

such a matrix now this is just another

representation of the rotation group and

it's a 2 by 2 representation there's a

subtlety about about this which I'm not

going to get into but about some of you

may know it that the two valued Nisour

these representations none important is

this this is going to represent a

rotation of the components of a spinner

of a half spin particle when you rotate

the the directions of space alright so

what's the first thing that's important

well first of all when you act on a

state you should get another state if a

state is characterized by the sums of

the squares of the elements being equal

to 1 what does that mean that means

alpha 1 star alpha 1 plus alpha 2 star

alpha 2 equals 1 then the same should be

true after rotation so this should equal

well first of all should be equal 1 but

it should also equal alpha 1 prime star

alpha 1 prime plus stop at that Plus the

same thing for two well it's very much

or similar in pattern to the fact that

the sums of the squares of the

components of a vector should be

conserved under a rotation the only

difference is here we're dealing with

complex numbers here the half spin

system is described in terms of complex

components here incidentally let's count

components

if yeah how many components does it take

to pick a direction to write how many

independent components are there here

for for their complex numbers and they

each pair of them but we always know we

don't care about the phase of these

things the phase of them doesn't matter

so dividing through by the phase and

forgetting by the overall phase that

cuts it down to 3 there are only really

three independent numbers describing

such a spinner but what else do we

require now for one start off for one

player and that's one equation so really

there are only two independent things

here two independent things even though

there are four complex numbers one of

the parameters doesn't matter the

overall phase it never affects anything

and the other is the length of the

vector the sums of the squares of the of

them are always set equal to one so

given any pair of components or given

any spinner like this there's always

some direction that it's polarized in

but it's along that that its axis is

along but how do you what are the

rotation what are the rotation operators

you well they first of all the most

important thing and the only important

thing really is that they have to

preserve the length of any given vector

not the length in three-dimensional

space but the length meaning the total

probability here that gives rise to some

very very similar condition to this over

here it gives rise to a condition which

is very similar to our transpose times R

equals 1 I'm not going to work it out

now you can work it out yourselves it's

the condition that u transpose complex

conjugate times u

is equal to one it's just an extra

little complex conjugate conjugate

because when we some things we sum them

multiplying by the complex conjugate

this combination here the transpose

complex conjugated is called the

hermitian conjugate and it's represented

by u dagger so we've seen that before u

dagger u dagger is equal to the

transpose complex conjugated transpose

means you flip things about the main

diagonal complex conjugate you just

complex conjugate every element u dagger

is equal to u transpose I wrote it here

I don't need to write it again so u

dagger times u is equal to 1 and in fact

that's all we're really going to need

there is a 2 by 2 representation of

rotations in space now complex matrices

and their unitary this is the condition

for a unitary matrix how many components

does the unitary matrix have can you

figure that out hmm well every every

it's a complex matrix eight real

components right eight real components

for complex components but now are not

quite I mean now there's a car there's a

bunch of relationships here now how many

relationships is this I heard the right

answer for why is it four because this

is a matrix equation and there's a

command there's a separate equation for

each component there are four components

this is for real equations here are for

real for real equations and so there are

for real equations among eight

unknowns there are four independent

parameters of a unitary 2x2 matrix now

that's one to many because we've already

found that rotations how many parameters

characterize the rotation three the

direct very unit vector which is 2 and

the angle was 3 so there's one to many

components here one to many degrees of

freedom to actually describe the

rotation group but there was an obvious

candidate for a for one more well I

don't know how obvious it is but there's

a candidate for one more restriction

that we can put on these unitary

matrices which will cut the number of

parameters by one more and that is to

set the determinant of them equal to one

okay why the determinant well first of

all you can see that the determinant of

the product of two matrices is just the

product of the determinants determinant

of a times determinant of B is the

determinant of a times B so if we were

to set the determinant of every u equal

to 1 then at least that would be

consistent because when we multiply two

use together to get another u we would

still have the determinant equal to 1 so

it is actually a theorem this is very

easy to prove you can prove these so

this is a one-liner basically that if

you were to take only the matrices the

unitary matrices which have determinants

warn that they form a closed group

setting the determinant equal to 1 does

not destroy the group property simply

because first of all the unit operator

has determinant 1 and since the product

of determinants is the determinant of

the product they're still as a product

structure to the group so one additional

equation that one can impose without the

store

the group property let's just write it

as determinant of U determinant I'll

indicate by a pair of brackets like that

is equal to one it's also true that the

determinant of U dagger is equal to one

there are complex conjugates of each

other so the group of unitary matrices

two by two unitary matrices with the

property that every determinant is equal

to one is first of all a three parameter

group it has the same number of

parameters as the rotation group in fact

it is the rotation group there's a

subtlety there which I won't get into it

is the rotation group it has the same

multiplication table as the rotation

group it is the rotation group but it

doesn't back on vectors it acts on the

states of a spin 1/2 system so we've

discovered something we've discovered

that there are two by two

representations of the rotation group no

it's complex conjugate of it if it's not

warning if you I you would not wanted

the complex conjugate no but if you have

the equation u dagger u equals I and I

mean ignoring the determinant condition

it's as determinant of U times the

determinant of U dagger is one such as

the determinant of U dagger no it has to

be it can be e to the I theta and e to

the minus I theta yeah okay but now we

have fixed it we have fixed it so the

determinant is equal to one all right

the group our definition the group of N

by n unitary matrices is called you in

the a special case is one by one unitary

matrices

that's u1 that's a thing up there all

right the group of

unitary matrices with determinant one is

called the special unitary group su n s

u n special unitary group that plays an

enormous role in physics s U n special

unitary n by n matrices okay so this

group here which acts on the two

components of a spinner is su - that's

su - let's go one step further before we

turn to quarks one step further is

everybody happy with this this is what

I'm waiting

Sydnei to see that's discussed last

semester would come in the spin matrices

the Sigma's you're talking about the

Cygnus X community with this y equals is

yeah yeah okay so yeah that is a good

question I will tell you I'll tell you

right now then okay good let's let's do

that right now

right there were the matrices s one two

and three and they were actually just

half the poly matrices I'll assume you

remember what the poly matrices are okay

think about group elements which are

very close to the identity that means

rotations by very small angles rotations

by very very small angles the operators

or the matrices should be very close to

the unit operator right so we should be

able to write those the special case of

small rotations we should be able to

write them as having unitary matrices

which are close to 1 1 plus something

small and then the indicate small let's

put an epsilon there epsilon times some

matrix okay epsilon times some matrix R

let's first ask what is the condition

that yeah now we want to know what's the

condition that U is unitary all right so

let's find out let's multiply u times u

dagger u dagger this is not V this is u

dagger

let's multiply it by u dagger 1 plus

epsilon M dagger the hermitian conjugate

of 1 is just 1 I'm taking epsilon well

let's see we'll take epsilon to be to be

real for the moment let it be it's just

a small number it's just a small number

to indicate smallness anything complex

can go into these M's here and this is

going to be 1 plus M dagger and this

should be equal to 1 all right when we

multiply this out I'll only keep things

to linear order in epsilon we're going

to drop things the quadratic order in

epsilon and that says that epsilon

M plus M dagger is equal to zero we have

one x one over here which cancels this

one quadratic things we don't care about

we have epsilon M plus M dagger is equal

to 0 since the ones canceled in other

words what it says is that whatever M is

it should be minus its hermitian

conjugate okay now if we this is called

anti hermitian the thing which has this

property is called anti hermitian we

make something hermitian out of

something that's anti hermitian is

multiply it by i let's so let's think

about putting an I in here let's go from

the beginning and put them I in here

what do we do over here - i hermitian

conjugation always involves complex

conjugation among other things if we did

that then we would get M minus M dagger

equals 0 because of this my relative

minus sign and then we will find that M

equals M dagger in other words if we

incorporated an I into the definition

here then M would be hermitian M is a

hermitian two-by-two matrix right that's

a hermitian two-by-two matrix

how many hermitian two-by-two matrices

are there how do you make a hermitian

two-by-two matrix oh something else what

about the determinant what's the

condition that the determinant is equal

to one this is a little trickier um yeah

what is the condition oh oh oh I know

mm-hmm okay yeah let's just write this

in the following way it's 1 plus I

epsilon M minus M dagger and then order

epsilon squared so let's forget order

epsilon squared

this is the determinant of one plus a

small matrix

you know what the determinant of 1 plus

a small matrix is anybody know it is one

plus a small number custom is one of the

skin e 2 e 2 something could you

proximate oh good you could do that yeah

it's easier than that though um yeah

let's let's look at let's do it 1 1 and

then a small matrix plus em 1 was a plus

em 1 1 plus m12 m21

and 1 plus em 2 2 I haven't put in the

epsilon in okay but we'll just treat em

as a small thing

let them be a small thing what's the

determinant the determinant is this

times this minus this times this this

times this is quadratic and small

numbers that doesn't matter

m1 1 times m2 to is quadratic and small

numbers but there is a piece here which

is 1 times M 2 2 plus M 1 1 times 1 what

is that that's m1 1 plus m2 to trace the

trace of M the trace of M so the

determinant of 1 plus a small matrix is

R is basically just the trace of the

small matrix so

yeah PMS after the the bottom line is

the MS have to be traceless yeah the

bottom line is the MS have to be

traceless that's that's that we can

prove all right so we have we have to

construct a hermitian small matrix which

is traceless that's exactly what these

Sigma's are they are the traceless

two-by-two hermitian matrices any

traceless two-by-two hermitian matrix

can be written as a sum of Sigma

matrices so these M's here are simply

linear combinations of the Sigma's the

particular linear combination that you

choose will depend on the axis of

rotation if you want to make a small

rotation about the x axis

you'll put Sigma X here if you want to

make a small rotation about the y axis

you put Sigma Y there and so forth if

you want to make a small rotation about

the linear combination of the x and y

axis in other words a 45 degrees you put

the linear combination that's the

connection between the Sigma's and the

rotation matrices they're the

representations of the small rotations

okay the last thing is how to combine

you know what I think I'm going to wait

till next week to talk about combining

representations and just jump the quarks

let's get off the mathematics for a

moment or two we only have a moment or

two so let's talk about quarks

now we're not interested in the spin of

quarks where we are interested in the

spin of quarks it's been a half but

we're not that's not what we're talking

about now I'm interested in the color of

quarks and the color of quarks is

described by a three state system red

green or blue so if I had a single quark

that quark could be in one of three

states just as a spin could be in one of

two states the quark color can either be

red green or blue and so we could

describe the state of a quark by three

entries the two three entries will

correspond to red green and blue but no

an alpha one and alpha 2 and alpha three

and the sum the squares of alphas will

just be the probability that it's a red

quark a green quark or a blue quark and

[Music]

what are the possible symmetries oh and

another thing we can say let me just go

one step further and say we could also

think of the three fields the field

operator for a red quark the field

operator for a green quark and the field

operator for a blue quark and assemble

them all so in a vector like this

what kind of symmetries can we imagine

among the three quarks we can imagine

first of all certain discrete symmetries

we can imagine the discrete symmetries

which interchange them interchange red

and green or interchange green and blue

or so forth but we can imagine a larger

family that includes that incidentally

these rotation matrices here happen to

include the matrix 1 1 this matrix here

is a special unitary matrix so among

these rotation matrices is a matrix

which interchanges up and down this

means that the interchange group is a

subgroup of

the full rotation group happens to be a

rotation I think we have to put an R in

there somewhere don't we yeah we have to

put an R in too yeah yeah yeah that's

right

yeah to give it a determinant 1 that's

right

so the permutation of two things is a

special case is a special case of

rotations it's not that it's all right

is there anything more complicated that

we could do yeah there is the more

complicated thing we can imagine is

unitary Opera it's not obvious that

there is such a symmetry in nature well

I will tell you there is such a symmetry

in nature and in fact it's the whole

point of having color here is that it

adds another symmetry the physics

important symmetry that symmetry will

play a very important role in the

properties of quantum chromodynamics but

the symmetry is the multiplication of

the three components red green and blue

by special unitary 3x3 matrices right

same mathematics as appeared here except

the mathematics involves 3x3 matrices

I won't fill in all the components but

you know it's you one one that I thought

that I thought that dot 3x3 matrices

special unitary matrices determinant one

again the special that's called a

special that's called su 3 this is the

group su 3

now I'll tell you right now from the

start it is believed in fact it's

mathematically absolutely required that

physics is invariant under this su3

operation in other words it's a kind of

mixing up of the quarks which of the

colors of the quarks which is analogous

to the mixing up of the components of up

and down which is also analogous to the

mixing up of the directions of three

directions of space but this is not

ordinary rotations this is special

unitary matrices how many special

unitary let's count the number of

special unitary matrices let's count the

number of parameters how many parameters

to describe a special unitary 3x3 matrix

okay right 18 minus 3 minus 1 okay why

18 you've got the 9 elements 9 complex

elements that's 18 okay you'll have the

equations u dagger u equals 1 there are

nine such equations one for each entry

in the matrix here so that's 18 minus 9

and then we set the determinant equal to

1 18 minus 9 minus 1 is 8 independent 8

it's an 8 parameter group just like the

rotation group is a three parameter

group so there's an eight parameter

family of rotations I bet you won I bet

you're wondering what that eight has to

do with the fact that there are eight

gluons aren't you yeah it's the same

fact yeah yeah the same fact but we will

come to it right why aren't the nine

gluons because we threw away the

determinant that doesn't make any sense

at all but it's true anyway yep this is

it it's true

yeah so special unitary 3x3 matrices are

a particular representation of SU 3 but

su 3 is the symmetry group the basic

symmetry group of quantum chromodynamics

and just like quantum electrodynamics

was invariant under this operation here

and that told us that only the own in

the Lagrangian only things were the same

number of our size and side daggers can

enter the idea that the Lagrangian is

invariant under SU 3 also has profound

consequences for the structure for the

symmetries for the conservation laws and

so the rule is every possible term in

the Lagrangian of quantum chromodynamics

of quark physics should be invariant

under this group here we'll come back

and we'll start to talk about how you

construct quantum chromodynamics a

little bit I think we probably finished

for tonight I'm certainly finished oh I

had intended to go a little bit further

tonight and tell you a little more but I

think that was quite a lot and I don't

know how many of you followed how many

of you didn't follow but I hope you at

least get the flavor if not the color of

what the okay we'll go a little bit

further with this but then we'll get

back to some things that can be

understood without too much mathematics
