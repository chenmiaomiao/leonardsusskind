[Music]

Stanford University I'm going to do

something now I've wanted to do for

years I've really wanted to do this okay

ladies and gentlemen people out in the

audience viewing this from afar we are

now going to stop for a commercial break

I want you all to go out and buy my book

the black hole war my battle is Stephen

Hawking to make the world safe for

quantum mechanics in that book you will

learn about the cruelty of theoretical

physicists you will not only learn about

Schrodinger's cat but you will learn

about Susskind fish and how he flushed

them down the toilet audience please

yeah come on right now back to our

program you may remember that when we

last saw our Alice and Bob Alice was

crying bitterly because the cruel Bob

was forcing her to learn group theory

Alice sad to say is not finished Bob is

not finished with her tonight tonight we

will see Alice suffer more okay are

there any questions about the group

theory at the moment that now that we're

back to the story main storyline any any

questions about group theory we're going

to we're not finished with it we're

really not finished with it yeah

there's there's two parts of your expose

on group it seems to be some kind of

abstract mathematical objects that have

some kind of multiplication to pay right

and there's also the part on how those

groups acts on various objects right can

we disassociate the two or is it well

they they're completely related is the

abstract notion let's so let's take the

case of rotation of a spin alright

there's a perfect case to study

there's the abstract completely abstract

notion of a rotation in space and I

don't tell you what it acts on I just

tell you that is an operation that you

can do or physics has to respect

symmetry under the rotations of space

and so we must then say how does the

rotation of space act on the quantities

which describe which are physically

relevant right if we were talking about

classical physics we might just say that

the rotation of space R rotates the

coordinates of a particle it might

rotate the direction of a magnet

whatever it does we know how to describe

that we describe that by we know how to

submit how to describe that in quantum

mechanics the states of a system are

always represented by a linear vector

space there's the abstract notion of a

state of a system

and there's the concrete representation

of it in terms of column vectors how big

are those column vectors what's the

what's the number of entries into the

column vector well that depends on the

system but basically it's the number of

mutually orthogonal possibilities for

that system if the system in question

only consists of an electron spin then

there's only two states to mutually

orthogonal States spin up spin down if

it's two electrons and again we're only

interested in the spin then there would

be four states two up two down one up

one down and down one up

are if we're talking about a more

complex object for example the entire

motion of an electron its position as

well as its momentum then there are an

infinite number of states the number of

states that it takes to describe the

orbital ok the number of mutually

orthogonal states of an electron

speaking now about its position is

infinite it could be anywhere in space

or you could choose to describe it in

terms of momentum so the column vectors

describing an electrons position are

infinite dimensional an amplitude for

every possible location or for every

possible momentum so there must be

representations of the rotation group of

this group of rotations which are

infinite dimensional matrices and they

are they are just how what are the

matrices which act on the column vectors

which describe the system that you're

interested in the size of those matrices

will depend on the number of mutually

orthogonal States all right so let's

come back spin of the electron throw

away everything else out of your head

spin of the electron two by two matrices

the group elements are the abstract

rotations they're represented by two by

two matrices a spin one particle the

spin one particle has three mutually

orthogonal states the rotations are

represented by three by three matrices

in that case those three by three

matrices are familiar to some of you

they are the three dimensional matrices

which mix up the components of three

vectors

what comes after spin if the

three-halves not one-half well first and

zero what about spin zero spin zero

rotations don't act on at all they just

leave it alone okay so it's completely

trivial

you can think of it in some very useless

sense that that rotations are act on

spin zero just to leave it alone okay

that corresponds to one by one matrices

just the unit matrix that's all just the

unit matrix does nothing are two by two

that's been a half three by three that's

been one four by four that's been three

halves and so forth so the same abstract

group element the same abstract

symmetry operation may have many matrix

representations of different

dimensionality are that's an important

fact and we're going to we're going to

spend a little more time on it but let's

just review for a moment what the

symmetries we talked about the

symmetries of rotation of space on a

spin on a spin 1/2 particle in

particular on a spin 1/2 particle and we

said those rotation operations become

represented by matrices which I call you

you because the unitary so these are two

by two unitary matrices I won't bother

being more specific than just putting

dots there those 2x2 unitary matrices

act on the state vectors of spin 1/2

again I won't be more specific than

writing that let's erase it for a moment

and this is called a representation of

the group it's in one-to-one

correspondence with the group elements

matrix multiplication group

multiplication or a one-to-one

correspondence let's just flesh it out

what does it mean for matrix to be

unitary it means that its inverse is its

hermitian conjugate

but we know that the number of degrees

of freedom the number of parameters in a

unitary 2x2 matrix is how many how many

did we say they were eight to begin with

four elements each complex that's four

elements this is four equations that

cuts you down to four but there are only

three independent parameters the three

Euler angles if you like the three

angles describing a rotate the three

things describing a rotation namely the

rotation angle and the two parameters

which determine the direction of the

rotation so there are only three

independent parameters of a rotation

these matrices have one too many

parameters and to get rid of that one

extra parameter one more condition and

that's that the determinant of U I'll

just represent that we could write it as

Det but I'll just write it as absolute

value but it's not really absolute value

it's it's a symbol for determinants but

that is equal to one now a unitary

simple fact incidentally that when you

multiply matrices the determinants

multiply the determinant of a time's the

sorry the determinant of the product of

a and B is the determinant of a time's

the determinant of B all right it is

also true that the determinant of a

hermitian conjugate of an operator is

the complex conjugate of the determinant

of the original operator so here's what

we can say let's take the determinant of

both sides of this the determinant of

both sides of this is first of all the

determinant of u dagger u but that's

also equal to the determinant of U

dagger times the determinant of U and

what's the determinant of 1 1 is equal

to 1

one here of course means the unit matrix

or ones on the diagonal all right now

next thing is the determinant of U

dagger is just the determinant of well

that is the determinant of is the

complex conjugate of the determinant of

U right and if the determinant of U is 1

the determinant of U dagger is 1 and the

whole thing is consistent the only point

is that it is consistent it's a

consistent condition on use that's when

I say consistent I mean that it's

consistent with the law of matrix

multiplication if you take a bunch of

unitary matrices every one of which has

determinant 1 and you multiply them

together you'll again get a thing with

determinant 1 alright so it's a it's a

mathematical theorem which may not be

too surprising for many of you that the

special unitary matrices two by two

matrices which have three parameters in

them special means that you die to you

equals one that the group of those

matrices is identical to the group of

our rotations in three-dimensional space

now it's not quite true okay is there is

there nothing that says that the

determinant has to be real no permanent

of a it just has to be radius one right

the determinant of a unitary matrix must

be a pure phase okay that's just from

the fact that it's unitary okay for the

fact that unitary but you can take any

art here's the point you can take any

unitary matrix let's suppose its

determinant is e to the I theta you can

then multiply that unitary matrix by

well you multiply it by e to the minus I

theta over two

because when you calculate the

determinant you multiply two elements

together so if you took you and

multiplied it by e to the minus I theta

over 2 you would construct a special

unitary matrix all right so the point is

the extra phase that's in there is

almost trivial you can always get rid of

it by a redefinition of U and in fact

the rotation group doesn't contain this

piece here it's just isomorphic to the

matrices with with determinant 1 ok I

told you a little fib when I said that

su 2 is exactly the same as the rotation

groups it's not exactly there's a two to

one correspondence instead of a

one-to-one correspondence the unitary

operators U and minus u if u is a

unitary operator u dagger u equals 1 so

is minus you whatever u is right in fact

is a two to one correspondence the

matrices U and - you both correspond to

the same rotation in space but that's a

fine point that I which is not going to

play any special role in in what we say

at least for the time being so a simple

statement which is almost true is that

there's a correspondence certainly

there's a correspondence but that

there's a one-to-one correspondence not

quite true it's two to one

correspondence between the unitary

matrices two-by-two matrices the special

unitary matrices

those were determinant 1 and the the

group of rotations and so for that

reason the electron spin or the electron

wave function is called a doublet and

it's acted on by two by two matrices now

let's talk a little bit about the

generators of a group I think we

actually talked about it

let's be specific about it again the

generators of the group when you have a

symmetry and the symmetry is represented

by a set of matrices like this then

there's a concept of the generators the

generators have to do with infinitesimal

elements of the group infinitesimal

element of the group means in the case

of rotation a rotation about some axis

by an int by a very very small angle in

other words it's an element of the group

which is very close to unity unity means

no transformation elements which are

very close which are just very small

shifts of angles and so forth are called

infinitesimal elements of the group and

the generators of the group are very

closely related to these infinitesimally

small operations now one of the reasons

that the infinitely small elements are

important and interesting is because you

can build up any element out of a

sequence of small ones in other words if

I want to rotate about some angle by a

finite rotation I just think of it as a

multiplication of a bunch of

infinitesimal ones so if you know the

properties of the infinitesimally

generators you can put together the

entire structure of the group we're not

going to do that we're not going to

study that today but we are just going

to define the generators of the group

and the reason we're going to define the

generators of the group because because

they really are the conserved quantities

they are the quantities are that are

conserved and which played the role of

conservation laws once you know what the

symmetry group is ok so let's define

them incidentally for what I've written

here there's nothing specific to su -

this could be su in where n is the

number of elements the special unitary n

by n matrices

there of course not all isomorphic to

rotations it's only the su2 group which

is isomorphic to rotations of space

that's your 3 su 4 su 5 not so easy to

visualize okay so here we have the

definition and now let's take an element

which is very close to the identity it

doesn't have to be su to write it U is

equal to the identity 1 plus something

small and let's put an eye in for simply

notational simplicity it'll simplify

notations a small parameter epsilon and

a quantity which is often I'm not going

to call it GG for generator because

we've already used G for group element

and so therefore I will use T YT beats

me I don't know so U is 1 plus I T what

is T let's find out what we can learn

about T we use the fact first of all

that u dagger U is Warren

all right so u dagger u that's 1 plus I

epsilon T Oh incidentally it's easy to

prove that if u dagger U is 1 the new u

dagger is 1 I won't prove that for you

that that U and u dagger always commute

with each other

not for all operators but for unit Ares

so it doesn't matter which order you

multiply all right so it's 1 plus I

epsilon T times 1 minus I epsilon T

dagger if this is you then this is u

dagger I gets changed to minus I when

your complex conjugate and this is

supposed to be equal to 1 let's retain

things only to the lowest order in

epsilon epsilon squared is too small for

our interest tonight so let's just keep

things to order epsilon and that says 1

times 1 cancels the one there and it

says that I exelon times t minus T

dagger is equal to 0 or to simplify it

just says that T is equal to T dagger

what's an operator that's equal to its

own conjugate permission and hermitian

operators in quantum mechanics represent

observables hermitian operators

represent observable quantities for the

case of rotations

what are these T's what physical

significance do they have there are

three of them well first of all why are

the three of them they're actually an

infinite number of them but there are

three linearly independent ones so let

me explain why that is the reason is

because the rotation group has only

three parameters there's only three

independent ways that you can rotate you

can rotate about the x axis so I could

have made an infinitesimal rotation

about the x axis I could have made an

infinitesimal rotation about the y axis

or the z axis and in fact for an

infinitesimal rotation if I wanted to

rotate about some other axis what I

could first do is rotate a little about

the x axis and then a little about the y

axis and then a little about the z axis

another way to say it is that the

generators behave like vectors if I want

a vector in an arbitrary direction in

other words a vector rotation about some

axis about an arbitrary direction the

way I can think of it is making it up

out of the components the component

rotations about the x y&z axes so there

are three independent directions that

you can rotate in and three independent

linearly independent T's oh we missed

one point come back back up there is

this condition here the condition that

the determinant is one alright so let me

tell you before I get back we'll get

back to in a moment the determinant

being one the determinant of any matrix

which is of the form 1 plus

let's call it epsilon times a small

matrix the determinant the determinant

of M is equal to one plus epsilon times

the trace of small M the determinant of

a matrix which is close to the identity

is 1 that's just the identity and then

the small deviation is epsilon times the

trace that's something to prove when you

go home and prove that but we can see

what that means immediately it means

that the trace of T is 0 the trace of T

has to be 0 in order for the determinant

of U to be equal to 1 alright so that's

the second condition the trace of T is 0

and it should be hermitian how many

independent hermitian two-by-two

matrices are there with trace equal to 0

the answer is 3 of them

and they correspond to the rotations

about the three axes but more abstractly

and generally the generators of the

group of rotations are the angular

momentum operators for a system so

that's what angular momentum means in

quantum mechanics it is the generator

the generators of the rotation group

until you act with the angular momentum

or 1 plus I epsilon times the angular

momentum to rotate a system a small

amount and then if you want to rotate it

a large amount you just do it over and

over again so everything is contained

all the information about the structure

of the group is contained in the

generators in fact it's contained in the

commutation relations of the generators

those are the important things I won't

go into them again we did commutation

relations of angular momentum

I just want to connect things up a

little before for you but the important

thing is that the conserved quantities

associated with the symmetry are the

generators and so their term three

independent two by two major seeds

satyam there are three independent two

by two traceless two by two hermitian

matrices yeah I have a name

Polly Polly miss yes

no three power matrices and then if you

went to three by three matrices nearby

three unitary matrices unitary traceless

and there are eight like the kill mom

yeah they over give them are matrices

all right we're going to do that a

moment that eight is the same eight as

the a gluons in Eightfold way actually I

did that's a day that's actually a

different eight not because it's it's

mathematically the same but it's

associated with a different SS you three

symmetry than then color but yeah

mathematics is the same okay so that was

a little bit about a little review the

sorrows of Alice let's let's let's torch

our Alice even more let's go to su 3 su

three the pattern is exactly the same

except with talk we're talking about

three by three matrices in fact I'm not

even sure that there's very much more to

say about it other than doing some

Counting and finding out how many

independent generators there are so to

do the counting it's very easy a three

by three unitary matrix has how many

elements Emily starts with 1818

independent nine independent complex

numbers that's that's 18 but then we

have u dagger you

one now this really is a equation for

each element this is a product this is a

matrix product so we can think of it as

I J and this is Delta IJ over here

how many equations is this this is nine

equations so we have 18 minus 9 is 9 but

then one additional equation that the

determinant is equal to one that's eight

equations and so we can guess that there

are eight different if we start with the

if we start with the unit matrix in how

many distinct directions in the group

space can we deform away from the

identity and the answer is 8 the

implication being there are eight

linearly independent 3x3 traceless

hermitian matrices traceless hermitian

matrices the number of parameters is 8

so and we are going to come back to that

[Applause]

but before we do let's talk a little bit

about our representations combine to

form new representations now what we're

talking about here is combining systems

together to form new systems in the case

of spin we might be talking about

combining more than one particle

together to create some sort of

composite for example and that composite

would also have a spin let's not worry

about the motion of the particles let's

just think of them as things that we

staple on top of each other so they're

nailed down to each other but each one

has a spin so each one has a spin and

let's suppose that we take two such

particles we put them on top of each

other to half spin particles what do we

get

well we get four possible states but

those four possible states can be

thought of as a

a basis in there for particle States can

be thought of as a spin zero object and

the three spin one objects that about

1/2 the two half spins can make we take

two half spins we can certainly make a

spin one why we can line up the spins in

the same direction so the Z component of

spin can be one it can be minus one and

it can be zero but it can be zero in two

ways all right but still it's been one

particle only has three states so one of

those two ways of making 0 must not be

part of the spin one multiplet what can

it be

it can only be spin zero why spin zero

because the kid is nothing for it to

transform into so there are three

combinations which form the spin one

multiplet and one which forms the spin

zero multiplet when you combine spins

together that way there are two possible

total spins you can make so if you were

to take an atom made out of made out of

two half spin particles and ignore the

orbital motion altogether one

possibility is that the spins are in the

same direction that would give you spin

one and the other possibility is that

they are in the opposite direction

in which case it would be spin zero it's

ortho and para hydrogen in particular

for the hydrogen atom where the two

spins would be the proton and the

electron right so you combine it's

important to know how to combine spins

and to know what you get what

possibilities you get when you combine

them together what happens in SU 3 now

we want to jump to su 3 and discuss some

very specific representations of SU 3

the important ones which we will discuss

first of all there is the triplet the

triplet is simply if u is a 3 by 3

matrix

then it has to act on a thing with three

components in the present context the

three components represent the three

colors of a quark so we're talking now

for the moment about one quart now three

quarks one quark and that quark can be

yet red yellow red blue or green it can

be red blue or green this is the

amplitude that it's red this is the

amplitude that it's blue this is the

amplitude that it's green and what does

the group do to them

it mixes them up it mixes up red blue

and green takes any particular state and

sends it to some quantum superposition

of states of mixed colors shall we say

so if we took a red quark that would be

like an up spin 0:01 and we rotated it

by this su3 operation we would get

something of a mixed character which

would have amplitudes for being red blue

or green some quantum superposition so

that's that's the meaning of these

operations but it's interesting and

important to know what happens if you

combine representations together let me

go back a step let me go back ya know

now we want to talk about various

representations of SU 3 the

representations of SU 2 are the spin

States it's been 0 1/2 1 3 halves to 5

halves and so forth those are the

representations of rotations we want to

know something about the representations

of SU 3 and I'm not going to tell you

very much just a very little bit there

are rather two and three important

representations for our purposes one of

them is just a three-dimensional

representation and it can be thought of

as the three components the three things

that go here could be thought of as the

three field operators for let's call

them quark red quark

blue quark green we can either think of

these matrices as mixing up

the states of a single quark or we can

think of it as mixing up the field

operators that create single quarks red

blue and green

now next this is all this representation

by 3x3 matrices that acts on the quarks

that representation is called the three

in the same language you would use the

same language you would call the half

spin particle of SU 2 you would call it

the two two four two states so the three

is a representation that's identified

with the quark field itself or with

quarks now there are also anti quarks

antiquarks their field operators are the

complex conjugates of the quark

operators so you can ask yourself if

there is a matrix which acts on Q to

give some new thing we could complex

conjugate everything we could complex

conjugate everything and we could say

let's let's write it if let's call it u

u is a three by three matrix if it acts

on the column vector Q I'm now being a

schematic you as a three by three matrix

q is a column vector if it acts to give

let's call it Q Prime the rotated Q then

what is it that acts on the complex

conjugate or the hermitian conjugate

field operator that's the object which

represents anti quarks well it's quite

obvious it's going to be the complex

conjugate the not the hermitian

conjugate the set of elements if u is a

bunch of elements then u star is nothing

but the complex conjugate elements go to

star let's call it star to be consistent

so

there is a second representation of su3

which is the set of matrices which are

the complex conjugate represent which

are the complex conjugate matrices for

every matrix u there is a complex

conjugate and that defines a second

representation it's called the complex

conjugate representation it is the

transformation properties of anti quarks

and that representation is called the

three bar this is very abstract but what

is it in the case of electrons what does

this correspond to in case of electrons

it is simply the fact that if the

electron wave function gets multiplied

by e to the I theta then the positron

wave function gets multiplied by e to

the minus I theta they transform with

complex conjugate group elements so you

would say that the electron the positron

are complex conjugate representations of

the u1 group that's the language the

quark and the antiquark are complex

conjugate representations of the group

su 3 it would be the complex conjugates

of the al-ahly splits in matrices

for the case su - yeah maro su - is a

special degenerate case where the su

with a complex conjugate is equivalent

to the original matrices by another

matrix and it's a special case it's

called a real group but this is this is

not important for us now the 3 and the 3

bar representation are quite different I

mean they look very similar to each

other but they are distinct they should

not be thought of as the same

representation of SU 3 they're quite

different and in fact the generators the

generators of the three bar

representation are the negatives of the

generators of the three representation

that's not too hard to prove that they

are the that means they carry the

opposite color if a quark carries a red

color then the anti quark carries a -

red color has the opposite value for the

generators all right so these are the

quark and the antiquark now what happens

if you take a quark and a quark to

quarks or a quark and antiquark just

like you could take two electrons and

make a spin one which was a triplet not

got to do with this three but thus the

triplet of SU - just like you can make a

spin one or spin zero you can do some

similar things with with three and three

bar you take two quarks and put them

together you can call that three times

three bar sorry three times three two

quarks are three this is just a notation

three times three means two quarks

sometimes this is represented by a

circle to indicate that you're not

actually multiplying numbers you're

simply building a space which is now a

space of two quarks it has nine

independent states red red red blue red

green and so forth all nine states and

if you work out what

representations of SU three appear when

you multiply three by three the answer

is first of all there is an antiquark

representation that's going to prove to

be interesting that if you take two

quarks you make something whose color is

the same as an anti quark that's a

little bit odd don't you think but it's

true it's true anyway and one more

representation called the six

dimensional representation of SU three

we're never going to need the six

dimensional representation but there is

a six dimensional representation of SU

three I can tell you what these things

correspond to if you think of the quarks

as just indices color indices then you

can combine the two coils let's think

about the yeah you can bind the two

quarks States symmetrically or

anti-symmetric Li you can combine them

symmetrically or anti-symmetric Li anti

symmetrically gives you the 3 bar

symmetrically gives you the 6 but this

is not terribly important point is if

you make two quarks somehow in the

laboratory the transformation properties

of the to quark system under this su 3

there will be one term or one way of

combining them together three

independent states of that system which

will be like an anti quark and the other

one will be this mysterious six which we

don't give a damn about we'll see why we

go on now what happens if we take a

quark and an antiquark

if we take any a quark and an antiquark

what we get is different then we get

when we get a quark and a quark we get

again six and three is nine States but

it's not the same nine possibilities

first of all we make an object which is

a warning what is a warning that's a

thing which is completely invariant

under the color operations roughly

speaking

it's a red plus Anantha a red anti red

quantum superposition of red anti red

blue anti blue and green anti green

that's one thing and that's a single

representation and it simply does not

transform under the su 3 group it's

called a singlet an su 3 singlet and one

way of saying it is it's the analog of

combining together two electrons to make

a spin zero state it's like a spin zero

state it does not transform under the

rotations doesn't transform at all this

is one state so how could it transform

is nothing for the transform into so

when you take a quark and an antiquark

there are nine states one of which one

linear combination ready anti red plus

blue anti blue plus green anti green

that just forms a singlet and then there

are eight others and those eight others

are called the eight dimensional

representation of SU 3 that eight

incidentally think about that eight for

a moment we've seen eight and another

place it was the number of generators

just like the number of angular momenta

when you rotate space the angular

momenta rotate into each other when you

rotate in color space the eight

generators get mixed up with each other

the way the eight generators transform

is called the eight dimensional

representation of SU three this is

sometimes called the adjoint

representation the words don't matter

it's just a representation that

transforms the same way as the

generators and that's what you get when

you multiply 3 cross 3 bar finally one

other operation what do you get if you

take 3 quarks 3 cross 3 cross 3 you take

three quarks there are 27 states

well you can do it in pieces you can say

if I combine together these two quarks

what I will get is either a one oh sorry

is either a three bar which is an anti

quark or a 6i so two of these quarks

together will necessarily either

transform as a anti quark or as a six a

six is a none as a peculiar

representation which I said we won't

care about very much now what happens if

you take this product and now cross it

again with three in other words we see

what we get when we combine two quarks

here's what we get and then we combine

it again with another quark we will

either get what appears if we take a

quark and an antiquark but we know what

that is that's one plus eight the plus

here just means or you either get a one

the singlet or an eight just like saying

you either get spin one or spin zero

that's what this plus means or when you

multiply 6 times 3 I think you get an 8

plus a 10 but this again is not very

interesting to us we don't care very

much about that the interesting thing

and the most interesting thing is when

we multiply 3 quarks together we get the

possibility again of a singlet of a

state which is completely colorless it

has no transformation property under the

color it's neutral it's just like taking

a plus charge and a minus charge which

cancel each other we get the singlet

which has no su 3 transformation at all

and it can be thought of as a

combination which simply is invariant

under the su 3 group under the su 3 of

the mixing up the quarks

what is it can we guess what it is like

I'll tell you what

it is it's just a red a green and a blue

quark but you have to be careful it's a

red green and blue quark anti

symmetrized not important

it's a red green and blue quark a red

green and blue quark are the singing of

the singlet then there are other

combinations red red green and so forth

they form the remaining states here but

the most interesting one for our

purposes will be this singlet here so we

see that when we take a quark and

antiquark just with regard to the colors

you can combine the colors in a

particular way to get a singlet plus

other stuff and when you take three

quarks you can combine them together to

get a singlet plus other junk is the

probability of these other things so

long that we don't consider it the

question is what the energy of them is

and I will tell you the energy of them

is infinite but we will come to that

right the energy of them is infinite and

so they don't appear in the spectrum now

how can the energy of them be infinite

and that's that was a great puzzle which

we now understand that I'm going to talk

about a little bit right right but now

ah there is one other kind of particle

in nature in sorry there's many other

kinds of particles in nature but there's

one of the particle in quantum

chromodynamics we're talking about

quantum chromodynamics QCD the theory of

quarks and gluons but of course we've

left out is the gluon the gluon is an

object which I think I've told you

before behaves as if it were a quark and

an antiquark with respect to the

symmetry it doesn't behave like a quark

and an anti quark with respect to what

happens if you hit it or anything just

with respect to the color symmetry its

colour properties are the same as a

quark and an antiquark but only the

eight it transforms as the eight

dimensional representation it transforms

the

same way as the generators of the group

so again it is this octet which is

separate from the singlet here

it's the remaining states here and

that's what a glue on is a glue on is a

thing with two indices like a quark and

an antiquark except a quark and an

antiquark arranged into this octet of SU

3 so it's not neutral it itself is not

neutral so let's let's quark postulates

if you like of quantum come off QCD it's

got an su 3 symmetry which i won't write

down the quark transforms as a 3 sorry

the anti quark transforms as a 3 bar and

the gluon or the gluon field as an 8

because these equations don't really

mean anything

particles can't equal numbers particles

or particles numbers are numbers this

just means the quark field transforms as

a triplet the anti quark as the anti

triplet complex conjugate and the gluon

is the eight which is a piece of a quark

antiquark this remaining possible gluon

doesn't exist in nature do we know why

not completely but the important point

about it is it doesn't mix up with the

other components and so throwing it away

is a consistent a mathematically

consistent thing to do because it

doesn't get mixed up with the other

components when you transform the SU 3

group that's that's group Theory has

applied the quantum chromodynamics

applied to quarks and gluons

are another postulate of quantum

chromodynamics and it's not really a

postulate it's a dynamical

put of the theory but let's take it as a

postulate and then explore what it means

in a moment

and that postulate is all of the

particles of nature the real particles

in nature not quarks and gluons which

are never seen singly but are always

seen in composites that the particles

which can be separated off and examined

individually can mail of particles of

finite mass the real things that occur

in the laboratory are all particles real

particles I don't know there's nothing

not real about a quark so I hate the

quantum the real particles the

unconfined particles the free particles

the liberated particles or whatever you

wish to call them free particles are

always transforming under the one in

other words they are singlets all the

real particles in nature are singlets

there is only two independent ways well

I'll tell you what the ways of creating

singlets are this mathematical fact now

there are only two fundamental ways of

making singlets out of quarks one of

them is to take a quark and antiquark

all right that creates a singlet the

other is to take three quarks now you

can do other things you can take a quark

and an antiquark and juxtapose it with

three quarks but the elements the basic

or you can take three quarks and another

three quarks three quarks in a singlet

and three other quarks in a singlet that

will also be in a singlet but all of the

objects that you can make up have the

quantum numbers of combinations of

things made out of three quarks or a

quark and an antiquark what about what

about the gluons themselves although the

first of all before we do it let's give

these things names what is an object

made out of three quarks or baryon a

baryon right baryon they always have

F spin and have spin when I say half

spin that can be one half three has five

half seven halves why because they're

made out of three half spin particles

what about the quark anti quarks this is

these are the ones of course in the 3

and 3 cross 3 cross 3

there's the triplet sorry the singlet

I'll call baryons the singlet and 3

cross 3 bar or they called quark and

antiquark

des armes now we left out one thing can

we make things out of the gluons can we

make things out of the gluons yeah there

is a thing that you can make just out of

gluons in fact if you take an 8 cross an

8 I told you roughly what happens if you

combine quarks together you could ask

what happens if you combine gluons

together or gluons with quarks I'm not

going to go through the whole list of

multiplication tables that you get when

you combine all sorts of things but

they're certainly at least one more

interesting thing and that's an 8 across

an 8 this is simply two gluons to gluons

no it's not obvious you get 63 states

altogether 8 cross 8 one of them is a

singlet well let's say 63 64 states

that's a 63 yeah there are 64 states and

a cross aid and the rest of them form 63

things which are a combination of

eighths and other things eight appears a

number of times I forget which I don't

remember which representations appear

but there are 63 other states none of

them are single it's just one way of

combining together gluons to form

singlets so you might ask is there a

particle which is composed of two gluons

just two gluons bound together into an

su3 singlet and the answer is yes the

all glueballs they're not made of quarks

they don't have any core content in them

they're fundamentally just a pair of

gluons you can also make three gluons

incidentally it's possible also in it's

also possible to get the more

complicated things but there are

Global's so the spectrum of hydrants the

spectrum of strongly interacting

particles which come from quarks and

gluons consist of baryons mesons and

glueballs

all of them are color

singlets color singlets is the watchword

now another fact another fact you can

check this yourself easily I think we've

actually checked it before remember now

all we can make is quark antiquark quark

quark quark or glue on glue on and

combinations of those what kind of

electric charges do we get if we combine

three quarks well I think we can get

start of spin I think we can get charge

to let's say we can get the zero one and

two we can get to by taking two three up

quarks three down quarks sorry with

three down quark of three down quarks is

minus one so we down quarks is minus one

and you're minus one zero one and two

but the important point is you cannot

make a fractional charge with three

quarks there is no way to take three

quarks and make a fractional charge what

about a quark and an antiquark

well again you can take an up an anti up

or 2/3 and minus 1/3 now 2/3 and 1/3 you

know where you know top story is and you

can again make integer charges it's the

same as the charges down I did tell you

because the way that I group them oh

yeah it's

same as a down all of the quirks are

either up like or down like and they

come in three families the up two down

the charm is strange and the top and the

bottom but they're three replicas of the

same thing so all you can make is

integer charge particle and so from the

point of view of color the fact that you

only have integer charged particles

nature is the same statement as all the

particles combined always into su3

singlets the color singlet single is

like like a carrot tangle electrons is

that any significance here yeah other

than the way you transformer murder well

that is the way you make such states is

to entangle them very definitely

they are certainly entangled does it

have any I'm not sure well you you can't

separate them because they get stuck

together but but you know you can

separate them as far as you like and

just cost you a lot of energy so in

principle yes they're entangled

entangled objects not easy to manipulate

you wouldn't want to try to do an

experiment that type women not the

details of how you deaf or what what the

operations are all right left hand sides

got three plus three yeah which is the

group 3 group representation 3

okay so let's let me let me tell you

more mathematically what is going on

here yeah okay let's take su 2 first all

right and take two spin a half's we can

think of the two spin a half's in terms

of the field operators which create

their particles that's the easiest way

to think about it for the moment alright

so let's just call the field operator

sigh and there are two components to it

the sigh which creates a up spin and the

sigh which creates a down spin let's

call them sigh sigh I where I can take

on two values either up or down now

supposing we want to create two

particles if sigh creates a particle or

side dagger doesn't matter if sites a

particle how do we create two pause so I

creates a particle we can think of the

two components we can think of it as

side one and side two açaí up inside

down and the su 2 operations act on this

now that's one particle how do we make

two particles

well we act twice with sorry but we can

act with sigh up twice that creates two

up particles we can act with side down

twice that creates two down particles or

we can do it the one of each so let's

write sigh I sigh J

in fact these two operators don't really

have to correspond to the same particle

let's even we could even think of one of

them as being the electron the other

being the proton and a hydrogen atom for

example let's see let's even give them

different names

ah sine Phi they might be the same they

might not be but let's let's allow them

to be different for the moment okay so

this now is an object with two indices

it's an object with two indices it's

kind of like a tensor if we were

thinking about vectors in

three-dimensional space tensors are

objects with two vector indices this

object is like a tensor in that it has

repeated indices now su2 can operate on

it because su2 operates on psy and an ax

on Phi this is a collection of four

objects

up up up down down up and down down so

we could lay out those for psy upside up

so I Phi up side up Phi down and so

forth and so on

we could lay them out in an array and

then ask what happens when you act with

su 2 on this composite object here

well they get mixed up with each other

they get mixed up with each other for

the simple reason that the size get

mixed up with each other and the Phi's

get mixed up with each other and so

certainly the side times Phi's are going

to get mixed up with each other and it's

going to be a four by four matrix which

represents the same action as just going

through size and Phi's separately and

rotating them by the group action okay

now you look at these at the way these

things mix up with each other you look

at the way they mix up with each other

and you come to a discovery you discover

that the combination let's see what it

is sigh up fide down - sigh

owned by up doesn't mix with anything

else under this operation it just goes

into itself it just goes into itself

this is an easy thing to check you just

see how su 2 acts on side up and mixes

it with side down you see how it acts on

five down and you check what happens to

this particular combination and the

answer is nothing so this is a singlet

this is one the other three

possibilities where are they they are

side up side down plus side down fire up

this is a thought I'd have not put in

square roots of two but you could put in

the square roots of two if you wanted

this is orthogonal to this and then

there's sy up Phi up and side down Phi

down what happens when you do the SU 3

su 2 rotations on these states they mix

into each other in particular ways they

will mix into each other this singlet

does not get mixed with these three

states at all and these three states mix

up among themselves as if they were a

spin one object they get mixed among

each other and this is then called the

three spin one has three states these

three mix up among themselves this

doesn't mix up with anything so when you

combine two half spin States

that's are when you combine two half

spin States you make a 1 or you make a 3

depending on which combination you take

you make a 1 or you make a 3 you make

spin 1 or sorry you make spin 0 or spin

1 that's the sense in which these

equations are being used here

when you combine together a quark and an

antiquark there are nine different ways

to do it one of the linear combinations

behaves in this way here and it's a

singlet and the others

transform into each other eight objects

eight additional objects will transform

into each other so that's that's the

meaning of these equations here how many

of each kind of combination you get this

multiplication paper it should be two

plus seven state again okay so you have

to know some good products three for the

b2 plus seven or you have to know what

the representations of SU three are we

did a bit of work to find out what the

representations of SU two were and they

were all the spin half and spin in

integer spin particles we could spend

two more weeks studying su three and

find out what the representations of SU

three are what are what matrix

representations are there not there are

not matrix representations of every

dimensionality

there are matrix representations for su

2 that happen to be for every

dimensionality a matrix representation

of su 2 for su 3 not so there's the

singlet there's there's the triplet

there's the anti triplet there is the

octet the eight there's a ten is a

fifteen twenty the whole bunch of them

but not every number appears in the

possible matrices which have the same

multiplication table as su three so

that's it that's a bit of work to prove

we didn't want to go there I just went

there by saying all right here's what

you get and but the but the real

interesting point is the singlets that

appear the ways that you can combine

quirks together to get combinations

which don't rotate or which are the

analog of electrically neutral why do I

say electrically neutral because

electrically neutral are exactly the

objects which don't transform under that

u1 the things which the phase cancels

out of

remember go back again to

electrodynamics the things which are

electrically neutral are the

combinations where all the phases cancel

out if an electron has an e to the I

theta and a positron and e to the minus

I theta then an electron and a positron

the combination of them are neutral

don't transform at all two electrons

that gets an e to the 2i theta so it's

not called neutral or it's not called or

transforms under the group so singlets

are important but you should just think

of them as neutral objects with respect

to the two the transformation properties

and I mean just possibilities you could

just show with that singlet that that

transformation just one example there is

that the oh we can go through it yeah it

is a little too much but um one simple

way to see it I don't know if this will

help you at all if we write just write

this object here Epsilon you know what

epsilon IJ is it's the two-by-two matrix

which is the anti symmetric matrix yeah

and contract the indices this way it's

that that's equal to this that's equal

to this and it's easy to prove that this

is a oh okay this yeah I'll just spend a

moment at it in every dimensionality for

matrix matrix dimensionality there is

always an epsilon symbol which has a

certain number of indices for two by two

matrices the epsilon symbol and the

epsilon symbol is the anti-symmetric the

fully anti-symmetric matrix compose that

of zeros and ones okay all right

epsilon IJ is the two-by-two matrix what

about for what about for the 3x3

matrices in a three dimensional

and it's epsilon ijk requires three

indices alright so I'll tell you right

now if you take an su 3 epsilon ijk and

let's call it what did we call a quark

fields q qi q j qk then you make the

three quark singlet which has no color I

J and K have to all be different from

each other otherwise this is zero so

that's why I said a red a green and a

blue make a singlet okay well uh we

don't wanna make Alice suffer too much

tonight

for what it's worth I just happened to

bump into this in this other book that

eighty cross a equals twenty-seven so

let's write it down okay eight plus

eight all right so that means when you

when you take two eighths and put them

together in other words two gluons you

first of all make a singlet what else

well how does this again eight plus

eight plus eight okay I'll tell you what

this means in a minute plus ten plus ten

okay all right so let's see is that

right the 10 + 10 is 20 and eight native

this should make a well 8 times 8 is 64

oh it's no good plus 27

it's not even filled yeah well what do

you serve it at the end you say there's

a plus of 27

does that make 63 I can't tell

64 is that 64 okay good all right all

right so for your information this is a

fact I know I know the representations

of SU 3 up to 27 if that I think there's

a 35 but I don't remember but another 10

we don't know we're not up to 60 no okay

all right so what this means is first of

all there is one and only one

combination quantum quantum

superposition of states of two gluons

which makes a singlet one and only one

and that's the blue ball then it turns

out there are two orthogonal ways of

making octets - that's sixteen states

all together but they form two groups

and the first group mixes into

themselves without mixing into the

second the second group mixes into

itself without mixing into the first and

both of them form octet different

combinations different patterns of

symmetry of the wave function of the of

the state of the - core of the two gluon

system then there's something called a

Ken and again there are two distinct

ways of combining the gluons together to

make tens but who cares about tens

because they don't appear in nature

anyway and then there's a twenty seven

dimensional representation how about 3

cross 3 cross 3 ok so there's a singlet

I don't know I don't know we had them

written down but I don't remember it

fair to say that that what happens if

you change the sort of the basis of the

thing to thee let's go back to this spin

- Caze - thee for the singlet and the

triplet and the - up up up down down

very don't worry here yeah alright so

you have that and you

those four things as as a basis than a

matrix which describes the operation

factors into a esmad has one zero zero

sir

and then I see yes and a lower part that

is that move that moves that exchange

moves two three among themselves so the

make you can describe it in terms you

have a lot of matrix looks if you just

work in terms of the basis vectors up up

up down up up up up down down up and

down down then there's a certain set of

four the 4x4 matrices which represent

the group alright but if you work in

terms of these linear combinations this

one this one this one and this one then

the matrices are exactly the property

that you say there's a one over here and

then one 3x3 matrices down yet the same

thing for this other case here is the

one

yes it's that's right that's right the

matrices the big ape the big 64 by 64

dimensional matrices break up into a

bunch of blocks right let's block

diagonal in a particular basis right in

the basis that's right that's right

that's in fact what what you're saying

is that there

basis driving weeks that in which this

complicated matrix that simplifies into

but black bag that's right so there are

sixty four states so the SU three

operation has to be represented on the

two on the two gluon system as 64 by 64

dimensional matrices right but in some

basis those 64 then by 64 dimensional

matrices are a 1 and 8 by 8 matrix over

here another 8 by 8 matrix over here

then a 10 by 10 I don't have enough room

another 10 by 10 matrix and then a 27

matrix down there in a particular basis

that's exactly right

does it mix the other ones that's right

each that's right in the right bases

they don't get mix this one doesn't get

mixed with this one doesn't get mixed

with this one they only get mixed

together as an 8 dimensional

representation of the total basis

that basis you mean for this for a piece

of it like this well well when you

multiply I'm not I'm not sure what the

what the right right buzzword I think

you're looking for a particular term

which escaping me right now like I don't

think such a term exists but I know what

you mean

is don't exist in nature yeah there's a

well maybe you shouldn't say you

couldn't care about them but they won't

appear as real particles in the

laboratory we're going to talk about

what what creates this peculiar

situation that you can't have a freak

work by itself but we'll come to that so

let's talk about it a little bit

incidentally the quantum chromodynamics

idea goes back a long ways it goes back

a some time I know who it's doing embu

to your children number and number had

the idea quite a 1962 quite maybe good

ten years before quantum chromodynamics

became the standard theory of of quarks

and gluons in fact the whole idea of

color goes back to him he didn't call it

color I don't know what he called it and

the idea of gluons also in the same idea

and his idea was fairly simple he

understood that if you made color

singlets then you would not get

fractionally charged particles that was

his motivation what do you have to add

into quantum chromo into the theory of

quarks in order to have some dynamics

which will forbid particles of

fractional charge so he realized that if

the quarks carried this kind of color

quantum number

and if the color always had to be a

singlet then you would never get you

will never get fractionally charged

particles he had an answer to the

question of why particles should only

occur in singlets and it went something

like this

he said right now we now we need another

postulate and the other postulate is the

connection or the interaction between

quarks and gluons the postulate is that

gluons play the same role in quantum

chromodynamics that photons do in

electrodynamics

but photons couple to the electric

charge the source of the photon field is

electric charge the gluons there are

eight of them what are the sources of

the gluons what is the source of a gluon

unless there must be eight quantities

eight conserved quantities which you can

think of as being similar to charge and

each one of them is a source of that

particular

gluon of that particular species of glue

on the eighth the eighth gluons

correspond to fields which are similar

in some sense to to the photons or to

the electromagnetic field the

electromagnetic field is sourced by

electric charge what is the source of

the gluon field

well what eight quantities do we have

available the eight generators of SU

three which are analogous to angular

momentum for su 2 angular momentum is a

conserved quantity it's additive if you

have two objects you add their angular

momentum ah and color really means when

you speak of the color of an object

you're speaking about how it transforms

under the group but the actual thing

which radiates the thing which radiates

the gluon field is

the color itself or the color itself or

the generators of the color Group eight

of them and each one can emit the

appropriate kind of glue on the first

meaning of this is that if you take a

colored object such as a quark it's

going to be surrounded by a glow on

field so much like electrodynamics are

the quantum chromodynamics replaces the

electromagnetic field with a quantum

chromodynamics ield but the only thing

new about it is that there are eight

such fields and the eight such fields

transform the same way under that same

eight that's associated with the eight

gluons okay so that's the first thing

now the second thing is to know

something about about the dynamics of

electrical electromagnetism let's begin

with a charge and an anti charge a

charge in an anti charge attract each

other the meaning of that is that if you

bring them close together the energy

goes down right so a charge and an anti

charge have less energy if they're close

together than they are then if they far

apart that's why they bind that's why

they bind because the energy of a

neutral system is less than the energy

of the two charged brother the energy of

a neutral system is lower than the

energy of a charged system as a rule for

example the energy of two plus charges

is much more than the energy of a plus

charge and a minus charge how do I know

that because the two plus charges repel

each other you'd have to do work to push

the two plus charges together you get

work out of letting a plus charge fall

towards a minus charge so here's an

example where a system with a net charge

has more energy

then a system in which the charges

cancel out another way to think about it

is if you have two plus charges the

lines of force have to go somewheres and

so there's knit field out beyond the

object that net field has field energy

field energy is always positive it's

proportional to the square of the

electric field and so this field energy

stored in the fact that there are two

plus charges here if there was a plus

charge and a minus charge there might be

field in between them and yeah and let's

suppose you brought them very close

together there might be a little dipole

field in there but there would be no

field on the outside there would be no

large field energy on the outside and so

the field energy or the field energy

stored in a neutral system is less than

the field energy stored in a in a

charged system the larger the charge of

the electron the more profitable it is

let's say to have a neutral system

energetically or the less profitable or

the more expensive it is in energy to

have a net charge system just the bigger

the electric charge if we have if the

electric charge of the electron was a

thousand times bigger than it is the

self energy of the electron due to the

electromagnetic field would be much

bigger than it is in fact the repulsive

force between two plus charges would be

much much stronger than it is in the

amount of energy it would take to

assemble two plus charges would be very

much bigger than the energy needed for a

plus charge and a minus charge the huge

charge of the electron would then make

it very very prohibitive to have net

charge and very very efficient low

energy to have all charges cancel out so

if the coupling constant of

electrodynamics were large very large we

would be very used to the idea that the

low energy particles the low mass masses

energy of course the low mass particles

in

hhor-- the low mass objects in nature

would be electrically neutral if the

charge was big enough we might never

have discovered individual electrically

charged particles they would be confined

it would just be to prohibitive an

energy to pull them out of an atom for

example

so what Nambu said is look if I have

this quantum chromodynamics

and if color the color generator or the

color degree of freedom is the source of

the gluon field then if we make the

charge the numerical coupling constant

the the analog of electric charge if we

make it large enough then it will be

simply impossible to pull apart these

quarks into non singlet States a singlet

state as the analog of neutral pulling

them apart you would be left over with

net amounts of color which would cost

you lots of energy so he understood that

when systems were in the color singlet

state they were fully attractive and

pulled themselves together when they

weren't there was always an element of

repulsion that that meant that cost an

enormous amount of energy to pull them

together so that was namboze explanation

he said quantum chromodynamics has a

natural way of making sure that the real

particles in nature are integer charged

and that quarks always come in either

the quark antiquark combination or the

three core combination r and it was

essentially correct it turned out to be

correct but the dynamics is a little

more interesting than that so let's talk

about the dynamics and why the dynamics

is more interesting any questions up

till now okay why is the dynamics more

interesting than that and the reason the

dynamics is more interesting than that

is because the analog of the photon the

gluon is charged carries color it the

glue on itself is not

neutral with respect to the remember the

neutral piece was this ninth member that

we threw away the eight gluons

themselves are not neutral they

transform under the eight it's as if

they had a color charge that is why

gluons don't appear in nature as objects

the color they they themselves are

colored and because they're colored they

have a big color field around them and

they're prohibitive in energy but this

is interesting what it says is that the

gluon itself is charged in a way that

the photon is not the fact that photons

are not charged means they don't

interact with each other they're not

sources a photon is not a source of

another Photon electrodynamics or at

least classical electrodynamics is a

completely linear theory meaning to say

that the electromagnetic waves just pass

right through each other that's because

the electromagnetic wave itself is not

charged and doesn't doesn't influence

other electromagnetic waves so

electrodynamics the photon and the

electromagnetic wave are very simple and

linear but in quantum chromodynamics

it's much more complicated the analog of

the photon itself is charged that means

that the analog of an electromagnetic

wave intersecting another

electromagnetic wave will be a serious

interacting phenomenon in fact even just

a single wave of a glue on one part of

it will interact with the other one part

of it may have some color the other part

of it may have some color those colors

will interact with each other and the

dynamics of gluons is far and then the

not just gluons but the field analogous

to the electromagnetic of the Maxwell

field is far far more complicated and

dynamically interesting but also much

more difficult to understand

turned out that the pretty much the

important thing that happens which is

new can be summarized fairly easily and

I'll summarize it for you on the

blackboard in terms of pictures the

equations that go with this there are

equations but but the pictures I think

are better than the equations there's a

quark an area and there is it's quantum

chromodynamics ield around it now in

electrodynamics the different pieces of

the photon field or the electromagnetic

field do not interact with each other

and so there's no sense in which one

field line

repels or attracts other field lines

they're just they're just completely

independent they don't interact with

each other in quantum chromodynamics the

gluon field itself is not neutral and

therefore the gluon field interacts with

other pieces of gluon field and the

result is very simple it turns out to be

fairly simple the lines of flux

basically attract each other they

attract each other and they attract each

other in a way which makes a rule about

lines of fluxes they don't end except on

another charge the lines of flux coming

out of a quark or coming out of a color

charge attract each other and in the

process of attracting each other

energetically they want to form tubes

they want to form tubes of flux with the

flux running right down the tube it is

more or less you can either imagine that

the lines of flux are attracting each

other or that empty space is repelling

the lines of flux and pushing them and

squeezing them into a tube that's what

happens that's pretty much the main

effect of the nonlinear interactions

between the gluon field that it makes it

energetically favorable to pick those

lines of flux and

and bundle them into tubes let's suppose

that's true now now supposing we have a

quark and an antiquark

we have a quark and the antiquark lines

of flux come out of the quark and go

into the anti quark if this were

electrodynamics those lines of flux

would separate and form the nice dipole

pattern that we're all familiar with

anybody who's ever looked at a magnet

then right all right

the field energy associated with this

big dipole configuration is relatively

small because the field gets weak far

away in this configuration there's a

uniform field no matter how far you take

these particles from each other there is

a uniform field in between just exactly

as if you took an electro electric or

magnetic field and pushed it through a

tube there would be a uniform field the

lines of flux don't end and because

there's a uniform field there's a

uniform energy per unit length what's

the result of that the result of that is

if you try to separate a quark from an

anti quark the energy just grows

linearly with the distance between them

as you pull this out it's like the gluon

field was really sticky really Turkish

taffy except accussed happy would get

thinner and thinner as you stretch that

out huh so it's not quite like chewing

gum of Turkish taffy it's like a kind of

chewing gum that as you separated it

always created more chewing gum in

between so that it never got thinner and

thinner there's always a fixed number of

lines of flux coming out of every

charged object and they don't disappear

so this tube it's called a flux tube or

flux ID and the flux ID has a uniform

charge per unit distance

any charged object which means any

object with nonzero color any none

singlet any object which is not a

singlet here it is it puts out lines of

flux those lines of flux bundle

themselves and unless they are unless

they in an object of opposite color that

object is just going to have an infinite

charge because those lines of flux have

to go someplace they'll end in infinity

the cost and energy will be infinite

that's the basic dynamics of quantum

chromodynamics linear flux tubes like

this which are the ingredients which

keep quarks from flying around freely if

you hit a quark real hard inside amazon

this is a picture of a sort of extreme

picture of amazon a quark and an

antiquark you hit that quark hard it

goes flying out but it simply can't get

away the field energy just increases and

increases and increases linearly with

distance until you've run out of kinetic

energy and then it gets pulled back or

something else happens what's the other

thing that can happen right yeah right

the other thing that can happen is that

the string can break if this is a quark

and this is an anti quark then

spontaneously out of a vacuum particle

pair production can create an anti quark

over here and a quark over here but you

still haven't created a quark you've

created two massan's so you give one

quark in amazon a give good shot you hit

it really hard it tries to escape and

either it can't escape because it runs

out of energy and gets pulled back but

actually more likely what will happen is

a quark and antiquark will be created in

between and you'll just create two

Amazons if this quark over here is still

going too fast it may still try to

escape at me

to escape this one over here what will

happen and so what happens when you hit

a quark really hard is that inside

Amazon is that a whole bunch of mess ons

go flying off forming what is called a

jet oh yeah oh yes absolutely you can

get anything as long as it's neutral

right this is the picture of a mess on

the other ingredient that is in quantum

chromodynamics

is that three quarks can exist this

doesn't explain three quarks the three

quarks are explained by a mathematical

fact that the flux lines can come

together in threes quark quark quark and

[Music]

but that's not too surprising because

three quarks again make a neutral object

three quarks again make a neutral object

and that means that if you have three

quarks there'll be no net lines coming

out of it

so somehow the lines of force that come

out of each one of them have to be able

to cancel each other that's quantum

chromodynamics it's based on the SU

three group and it's called a gauge

theory a gauge theory is simply any

theory where the conserved quantities

are coupled to a Maxwell like field or

coupled to a field similar to photons it

has a deeper meaning than that but for

our purposes anytime there is a

conserved quantity analogous to electric

charge which functions as the source of

a photon like field photon like field

blue on like field that's called a gauge

theory the gauge theories are always

based on symmetries why are they based

on symmetries because they're based on

the idea of conserved charge and

conserved charge means a symmetry of

some kind incidentally why what's the

connection

in between conservation and lines of

flux conservation and lines of flux are

intimately connected if you have a rule

for example in electrodynamics that

every charged particle has to be the

source of lines of flux and that lines

of flux can only end on charged

particles then charge has to be

conserved

there's no way none of these lines of

force go off to infinity well you could

say I could make this charge suddenly

disappear if I allow the lines of flux

to simultaneously all disappear but that

would violate the speed of light

constraint you would be able to send the

message arbitrarily far distance

if by simply removing that charge you

suddenly changed the field at infinity

the fact that you cannot send a signal

faster than the speed of light tells you

that you can't remove this charge why

because it's sort of anchored by the

flux lines at infinity and if you could

remove it either one of two things

either you would send the sudden signal

far away that the charge wasn't there by

removing the field or you would be left

over with these lines of flux that don't

end on charges so if lines of flux have

to end on charges the next tantamount to

saying that the sources of the field are

conserved which in another language says

there must be a symmetry so some

symmetries are connected with photon

like fields which give rise to lines of

flux those theories are called gauge

theories and you can't even imagine

without breaking the rules of a theory

what it would mean for the charge not to

be conserved because the rules of a

theory a patch the charge particles to

the to the lines of for our force okay

that's that's quantum chromo then

Amyx now we've actually gone either

depending on how you count either 2/3 or

3/4 of the way through the standard

model we've gone through 9 generators if

you like the 8 generators of SU 3 and

what's the other one the electric charge

per pound which is not the ninth

generate energy 3 the electric charge

those are nine conserved quantities they

coupled to the 9 gauge fields the eight

gluons and the photon the standard model

has three more generators which we will

talk about so that's we've got 9 out of

12 that's 3/4 the other way of camping

is to say we studied su 3 that's quantum

chromodynamics we've studied you one

that's electrodynamics the standard

model is su 3 course su 2 cross u 1

we're missing the su 2 the su 2 not

that's not angular momentum there's

another ingredient in the standard model

called su 2 we'll pick up it will start

to take up su 2 next time we've covered

a lot of ground and I think in about two

more lectures we can probably finish off

the basic structure of the standard

model su 3 cross su 2 cross u want u 1

put it together into a package and and I

think the other element that we need of

course is the Higgs field the Higgs

field plays an important role there but

um I would say within about three

lectures we will have the working parts

of the standard model and then we can

start to explore what the puzzles of it

are why why people think we have to go

beyond the standard model and why people

think there are going to be interesting

new things discovered at certain I think

that's what we want to get and okay good
