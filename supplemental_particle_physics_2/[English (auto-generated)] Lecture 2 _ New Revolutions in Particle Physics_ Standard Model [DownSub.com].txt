Stanford University before we start

we're going to talk about quantum

chromodynamics today quantum

chromodynamics and we're not going to

talk about the deep mathematics of it

and go into it we have basically one

lecture to do quantum chromodynamics

which is a huge subject it's a subject

which easily takes a quarter to but I'll

stick with the highlights and tell you

what the basic intuitive picture is

quantum chromodynamics is similar to

quantum electrodynamics quantum

electrodynamics is the theory of

electrons and photons it's also the

theory of the Coulomb force the quantum

mechanical theory of the Coulomb force

if applied to the problem of atoms in

which you do not worry about the motion

or the nature of the nucleus the

structure of the nucleus you simply

think of the nucleus as a fixed point

creating an electric field then quantum

electrodynamics is also the theory of

atoms and the same sense quantum

chromodynamics

is the theory of quarks and gluons and

the theory and the things that quarks

and gluons make the things the quarks

and gluons make a called hadron is h a d

R o n s hadrian's or hadrons and they

consist of things like protons and

neutrons which are called baryons which

have an it quark number or a net baryon

number that means an imbalance of quarks

and antiquarks three quarks for the

proton three quarks for the neutron and

mesons which are quark antiquark pairs

and all of them are full of gluons

gluons are the electrically neutral

stuff

which is the glue and the binding stuff

that holds the quarks and gluons

together much the same way that the

electromagnetic field or a Coulomb field

is the binding agent that holds atoms

together atoms other electrostatically

bound objects all right but before we go

into it I want to remind you a little

bit about the mathematics of spin

because very first of all that

particular mathematics will come up in

another guise but also a simply related

mathematics to it will also come up in

the guise of a quantity called color or

concept called color we're not going to

do group theory in this class all right

we'll try to finesse it but the basic

mathematics of what we're talking about

is group theory as I said I'm not going

to use group theory or at least not not

call it group theory as we use it for

the four spin the theory of spin is the

theory of a group a group if you don't

know what a group is just ignore it all

right but the group is the group of

rotations of space the theory of spin is

also the theory of the symmetry of

physics with respect to rotations of

space but we finish that by not talking

about the theory of rotations but by

talking about the theory of angular

momentum I'll just remind you very

quickly that we derived everything about

angular momentum from some basic

commuted commutation relations which one

of the form LX with ly

equals I times LZ I think there's an H

bar in there but the other is an H bar

in there where those are the components

of angular momentum we work that out

last quarter

and we found some rather surprising and

interesting things oh of course

there are three other relations like

this which I've gotten by permuting X to

Y Y to Z and Z back to X I won't write

them down but when we are worked out the

consequences of this first of all we

broke the symmetry now when I say we

broke the symmetry I'm not talking about

something some symmetry breaking in

nature just we broke the symmetry in our

mathematical description the symmetry

being the symmetry of rotation or the

symmetry which interchanges XY and Z and

so forth we broke it in our heads maybe

not in the real physics but just by

focusing on the Z component of spin on

the Z component of angular momentum we

basically focused on it we cannot

measure all three components

simultaneously they don't commute with

each other here they are they don't

commute with each other at most one of

them commutes with itself of course it

commutes with itself and no two of them

commute so most you can talk about one

of them are or measuring one at a time

and we arbitrarily chose LZ when we did

that and use these commutation relations

what we found was first of all that L is

quantized and the difference between

neighboring values of L was always one

unit in units of h-bar number one number

two we focused on a on spin and we

described different spin possibilities

the first set of spin possibilities were

the half spin objects are the things

which we call fermions those who are the

object whose spin was centered about

zero in such a way that the first level

the first Z component of spin was 1/2

and the first one in the opposite

direction was minus 1/2

three halves minus three halves and so

forth those were fermions but right

right now the main point was that the

mathematics of spin or angular momentum

gave rise to some multiplets there was

first to spin half multiplet that was

the multiplet with a spin minus 1/2 and

it's been plus 1/2 like the spin of the

electron that was associated with half

spin particles and fermions bosons which

for our purposes now just think integer

spin the first one was just spin zero

there are particles with spin zero they

have no spin that's all they just have

no spin at all then there are particles

will spin one the photon is a spin one

particle there are other spin one

particles there are nuclei and atoms of

spin one and they have three states plus

one minus one in units of h-bar and zero

and then the next interesting family has

spin three-halves spin three-halves

again goes on the half spin column here

and that has 1/2 minus 1/2 three-halves

minus three-halves r there are particles

with spin three-halves there are

certainly nuclei with spin three halves

and atoms with spin three halves so

these things also exist likewise what

comes after spin one spin to spin to

spin zero spin one spin minus one or the

Z component of spin 1 minus 1 2 and

minus 2 these labels here are the Z

components of the spin okay now when you

speak about an object of spin L L is the

notation that denotes the highest value

of Z component of spin so this would be

or M you can use M ordinarily it's used

in

ah mrl doesn't matter let's let's use L

let's yourself that was a little bit

different than anything when you speak

of spin L you're speaking about about an

object whose maximum spin along the z

axis is L so this would be spin 1/2 L

equals 1/2 this one would be l equals 1

and so forth how many states are there

how many independent states are there

for a spin a particle with spin L 2 L

plus 1 2 L plus 1 for example for spin

1/2 twice L is 1 plus 1 is 2 2 States if

L is 1 twice 1 is what is to add one

more that's 3 three states and so 2 L

plus 1 is the number of states is the

number of independent spin States for a

given value of for a given value of L so

that's where that's something I want you

to remember now another thing if you

have more than one particle such as an

electron then you have two spins spins

can be combined let's consider what you

can make in the way of spin by combining

together the spins of two electrons

let's forget the fact that electrons can

orbit around each other let's ignore

what's usually called orbital angular

momentum and just concentrate on the

spin angular momenta what kind of

angular momentum can you make for two

half spin particles

well the maximum value of the Z

component of spin is what one if the O

in units of h-bar let's forget h-bar now

when I say unit and the maximum spin I

mean in units of h-bar the maximum spin

you can have along the z axis is 1

that's when both spins are pointing

along the same when both spins are

pointing upward along the z axis that

axis is the z axis so you can have

angular momentum one you can have

angular momentum minus one and you can

also have angular momentum or Z

component of angular momentum zero but

in fact you can have two states where

the Z component of angular momentum is

zero this one and that and that one this

one and that one so there are two states

two independent states whose Z component

of angular momentum is zero how many

states are there for a spin one object

312 plus one okay so there must be a

spin one combination because we can make

total spin up equal to one that's the

maximum so there must be some where is

there a some combination must correspond

to spin one what does it spin one-half

it has spin one along the axis spin

minus one along the axis and spin zero

but there are two states with spin zero

with Z component of spin equal to zero

they can't both be part of the spin one

multiplet what could the extra one be

it's got to be either spin zero spin one

spin to spin three spin for spin a half

spin - it's been a half spin three

halves so here's what we found

let's let's write them down this both

spins up are both Z components of spin

I'm going to stop saying Z components

both spins up that's got Z component

equal to one both spins down that's got

Z component equal to minus one and then

there seem to be two with Z component

equal to zero but if I look at spin one

it all has is plus minus and 0 there are

only three of them so this cannot be a

multiplet this these four states cannot

all correspond to spin one what else

could be there besides spin one it's

been 0 can't be spin 2 because spin 2

has to have five space states the only

other thing is has been 0 so there must

be quantum states here 3 quantum states

corresponding to spin 1 and 1 when you

put the spins together and you ask what

kind of angular momentum can you make

you can make spin 1 and spin 0 the only

combination the only question is what

combination what quantum mechanical

combination of these two correspond to

spin zero and what combination

correspond to spin 1 the missing spin 1

combination and I will tell you right

now the answer is that the symmetric

combination with a plus sign

incidentally this state over here is

symmetric between interchange you can

think of it if you like as one spin over

here one spin over here J labelled is 1

over here and the one over here the spin

States if they're both up is symmetric

that means the spin state is the same if

you went to change the two spins

obviously they're both up this one is

also symmetric up down by itself is not

symmetric if you interchange spin if you

want to change the two of them this one

goes to this one and this one goes to

this one they swap but there's one

linear combination one quantum

mechanical combination which is

symmetric under the interchange of the

two plus minus plus minus plus this is

the symmetric state what should you do

to it to make it have total probability

equal to one divided by the square root

of SIL these are the three states which

together form 0 1 and minus 1 if you

rotate the axes they transform into each

other this is a spin 1 up this is a spin

1 down where's the ones with spin 1 in

the other directions it's made up out of

this ok so this is the spin 1 multiplet

and what about the other one

we're missing a state there were 4

altogether here we have 3 linear

combinations what's the other linear

combination the other orthogonal linear

combination with a minus 1 so there's

another one here with up down - down up

the square root of 2 this one this is

these three correspond to l equals 1

this one corresponds to l equals 0 so

these are the ways that you can put to

spin half's together to make the two

possible combinations

this combination l equals 0 what is it

like with respect to its angular

momentum the answer is it doesn't have

any angular momentum it's a thing

without angular momentum as far as

angular momentum goes it's like a

nothing I mean it may have some energy

and they have other things charged

whatever but as far as angular momentum

goes it's like empty space it's got

nothing okay

you might ask can a up spin and a down

spin come together and annihilate and

disappear well there's all kinds of

reasons why electrons can't disappear

but just for anger pure angular momentum

reasons and we just worried about

conservation of angular momentum and

nothing else then which of these

combinations can just disappear if as I

said if we worried about nothing but

angular momentum conservation can this

disappear no because it has two units of

angular momentum up about down how about

this one

yes or no let's take a vote how many

think yes everything no ok the noes win

because this one is not without angular

momentum it looks like it has no Z

component of angular momentum and it

doesn't but the angular momentum about

the X and y axis of this is not equal to

zero it does not have l equals zero it

has L equals 1 this is the missing thing

that allows you to rotate the angular

momentum into other directions what

about this one yeah that one has angular

momentum zero and if it was if the only

consideration was angular momentum

conservation

it could decay it could just disappear

now one way of thinking about it is you

could say well um yeah that's good

enough that's that's uh that's that's

close enough

this one here can disappear okay

if your measure the angular America Z

could get 1/4 - yes in which case no you

get with along the z axis you would get

0 in either case you know along the z

axis

but if you measure the angular momentum

along some other axis you would get 1 or

minus 1 all right so that's that's the

theory of angular momentum now why am i

bringing that up now or the theory of

spin in particular spin 1/2 spin 1/2 and

how you build out of it

other spins Oh incidentally let's spill

let's try to build spin three-halves

let's ask what happens if you put

together on three spins well if they're

all pointing upward in the same

direction

what's the and that would be the maximum

or would you get three halves how many

states are there with spin three halves

so incidentally how many states are

there altogether of of three spins each

with spin 1/2 8 2 times 2 times 2 okay

so there are eight states altogether how

many states are there for a spin

three-halves object four so how many

left over for what can those other four

be could they be another spin

three-halves object

No why not

to be 0 on the other okay so let's go

through it again if you have a spin

three hands multiplet there will be one

state which has Z component of spin

three-halves and one with minus

three-halves we've already used those up

when we said there were four states

which formed this through spin 3 has

multiplet we use them up now all that's

left now is spins whose maximum value is

plus or minus 1/2 ok so what can be

there what an addition can be there only

spin only spin spin 1/2 anything else

couldn't be no they can't be spin 0

because making 3 spin a half's can never

make spin 0 all it can make is spin

three-halves and spin 1/2 but we seem to

have four states left over the

implication is there are two distinct

ways to make spin 1/2 so there are

combinations which correspond to the

spin three-halves the easiest ones are

all three spins up or three spins down

and then there are more complicated ones

and then there are two distinct ways to

make spin 1/2 which altogether adds up

to four states all right so when you

take three spins three half spins you

get spin three-halves and you get spin

one half twice two distinct ways of

doing it let's keep that in mind okay

now why am i talking about spin now what

I really want to talk about is a concept

called ISO spin isotopic spin isotopic

spin was the first internal symmetry

group that or the first internal quantum

number the first analog of a spin which

occurred in particle physics that did

not have to do with the rotation of

space but it had to do with the rotation

of an imaginary space or an internal

space or if you like

it just gave rise to another set of

quantum mechanical variables which were

basically isomorphic completely similar

to spin to spin a head to spin but it

didn't have to do with spin it didn't

have to do with the rotation of space

you could imagine if you like that it

had to do with the rotation of some

internal directions internal directions

imaginary directions of space

mathematical directions so let me tell

you where it comes from we've already

actually described it although we

haven't said it we talked about quirks

and we talked about there's a whole

variety of different kinds of quirks but

most of the quirks were rather heavy

they were an a heavy and had an

appreciable mass in units of G V's or

hundreds of M V's the natural mass scale

for hadron physics is somewhere as

hundreds of M V's the mass of a typical

meson is a couple of hundred M V's the

binding energy of particles is M V's

milli ah sorry hundreds of em V's not

many these hundreds of MeV is what

object in nature has binding energies of

order a few M V's nuclei nuclei nuclei

things that hold protons and neutrons

together but what holds a neutron

together has three quarks has a binding

energy of a few hundred MeV all right so

the natural energy scale is a few

hundred MeV and there were only two

quarks which were very light but or

whose masses were very light by

comparison with that then they were the

up quark and the down quark the other

quarks are heavy and to make particles

out of them there's a cost in energy and

so for the lightest objects the most

stable typically heavier objects will

decay to lighter ones the light objects

of nuclear physics the lightest objects

the ones which are stable are the ones

made of up and down quarks now up and

down quarks have almost the same mass of

course the down quark is about twice as

heavy as the up quark but they both have

very small mass by comparison with the

hundreds of M V's of a of nuclear

physics so in some first approximation

you can say that the up quark and the

down quark have no mass they're more

important than masses are close to being

equal that's a symmetry what does that

mean that means if you took all up

quarks and replace them by all down

quarks everything would be pretty

similar now of course the up quark is

slightly more massive than the don't

know the down quark is slightly more

massive than the up quark

so typically things made of down quarks

would be a little more heavy than the

things made of the corresponding up

quarks but the difference is small for

example a two up quarks and a down quark

make a proton two down quarks in an up

quark make a neutron the mass difference

between a neutron and the proton is very

small okay so that's an example of the

almost symmetry between up quarks and

down quarks so a first approximation you

just forget the difference up quarks and

down quarks are symmetric with respect

to each other

in the same way you're in the

mathematically the same way that a spin

up and a spin down are symmetric in the

case of spin it really has to do with

the symmetry of space rotating the axes

in the case of up quarks and down quarks

it's just a mathematical manufactured

space that you can imagine where you

take an up quark to a Down quark by

flipping some direction in some

imaginary direction in your head but all

you're doing is interchanging up quarks

and down quarks thinking of up quarks

and down

quirks as mathematically the same more

mathematically isomorphic to up spins

and down spins you come to the concept

of isotopic spin isotopic spin is the

analog of spin but not up and down in

the sense of the z axis and the flipping

spin but up and down in the sense of up

quarks and bound quarks because there's

nothing really up to up up or down about

it it's just the interchange of two

labels are quarks and down quarks and so

when invents the concept of isotopic

spin our and for all mathematical

purposes the replacement of up quarks

and down quarks is very analogous to the

replacement by of an up spin by a down

spin okay so the spin we have two states

up and down and that defines spin for

quarks we have up and down and that

defines I so spin and certaintly what

does this it what does the ISO come from

isotope isotope we're going to see in a

moment that isotopic spin interchanges

and saying when when you interchange up

quarks and down quarks you want to

change proton and neutron of course if

you interchange proton and neutron in

the nucleus you'll wind up making an

isotope of some of something so it comes

from the word isotope isotopic spin but

what it is is in nuclear physics in the

old days it was just the replacement of

the interchange of a proton by a neutron

and thinking of the proton and neutron

as a spin multiplet in a mathematical

spin space it was traced eventually just

to the fact that there are two quirks of

quarks and down quarks that was the

origin of it you

did I suspend free day oh yeah that's

good Eisenberg yeah what something is

about the end of the charge yeah

okay so isotopic spin is not a precise

symmetry of nature it's not a precise

symmetry of nature in that first of all

the up quark and down quark don't have

exactly the same mass but even if they

did there would still be a distinction

of physical distinction which would be

which would make them different and that

is their electric charge electric forces

within the nucleus except for a big

nucleus when a nucleus gets big electro

electric forces become strong but for

small nuclei and especially for protons

and neutrons and hadrian's

electromagnetic forces are negligible by

comparison with the other forces holding

protons and neutrons together so an

approximation ignore the mass difference

between protons and neutrons or ignore

the mass difference between up quarks

and down quarks and ignore the fact that

they have electric charge altogether and

concentrate on the other forces of

nature in particular the strong

interaction forces which will come too

and then there is a precise symmetry

relating up quarks to down quarks and

that symmetry is very much like ordinary

spin symmetry it is analogous to spin

symmetry okay let's talk about what you

can make

supposing are well one quark by itself

we will come to a understand is not a

physical object that we can examine in

the laboratory the simplest object that

we can examine in the laboratory is

three quarks and that's a proton or a

neutron that's like having three spins

what can you make out of three spins

what you can make out of three spins is

either spin three-halves

or spin 1/2 and you can make the spin

1/2 and do two distinct ways but let's

forget the two ways let's just say we

can make spin three-halves and spin 1/2

in the same way

taking 3 quarks we can make an object of

isotopic spin 1/2 or an object of

isotopic spin three-halves let's first

concentrate on the object of isotopic

spin 1/2 an object of isotopic spin 1/2

how many states should it have just by

pure mathematical analogy with ordinary

spin to a spin 1/2 object has two states

so a nice have spin

I said I so spin together is the right

work is the simplified word an ISO spin

state of 1/2 also would have two states

what are those two states proton and

neutron so let's write down what the

proton and neutron are in quark language

now let's let them that's that's really

that's proton okay let's imagine that

we've labeled the the quarks by label

the quarks let's imagine they're really

located at three distinct spots inside

the proton this of course is not really

true but I mean they move around but

let's just simplify the story and say

there are three distinct quarks and

we're going to label them with three

distinct labels here's a down quark and

here's two up quarks

all right the down quark might be the

quark at position one all right so let's

call it at position one the up quark

might be at position two and the u k--

where the other up quark might be at

position three so anything wrong with

this state quarks are fermions right

what's a fermions because because quirks

are fermions their states should be

anti-symmetric their States should be

anti-symmetric

okay now that suggests that may be the

right combination for the U quarks is

two anti symmetrize it and that would be

correct that's not an important issue

for us right now but I'm just being very

precise that down quark and two up

quarks in an anti symmetric state is a

proton an anti symmetric state of two

spins makes spin zero so this is an ISO

spin zero object x and ISO spin 1/2

object that has I saw spin 1/2 but never

mind this is this is a bit of

mathematics it's a little too fancy we

don't need to worry about it this is the

proton it has charge plus 1/2 hat sorry

2 3

plus 2/3 is 4/3 and minus 1/3 makes

charge 1 so that's the proton and it is

the combination of 3 quarks which makes

an ISO spin 1/2 state same as 3 spins

making a spin 1/2 state so the proton is

also a member of a spin I so spin 1/2

object and the other one is gotten by

simply interchanging ups and downs and

that's up down down let me not let me

not belabor this point about the

symmetry here and that's the neutron the

proton and the neutron in this language

are symmetric with respect to each other

and they form an isotopic spin 1/2

double it in the same sense that you can

put three spins together to make a spin

1/2 and there are only two such states

so isotopic spin invades the theory of

protons and neutrons and in this

language just gives us another just like

a quark has isotopic spin 1/2 so does

the neutron and proton ok there's

another object which is very similar to

a proton Neutron in many ways it's also

made of three quarks but it's the

combination or incidentally what is the

spin of the proton and the tri-axial

spin 1/2 okay so you take is taking 3

quarks with the same spin sorry 3 quarks

with spin and 3 quarks with I so spin

and you've made a spin 1/2 and an ISO

spin 1/2 ok now there's another object

which has 3 quarks in it which has

spin three halves and I so spin three

halves if you like the three ordinary

spins are lined up in it in the same

direction and the three iso spins are

lined up so what kind of thing are they

well if the three iso spins are lined up

that must mean that there are objects

with three up quarks three up quarks

three down quarks also the three spins

are aligned just the ordinary spins the

three spins are also aligned the form

spin three halves or down or whatever

three quarks up three quarks read up

quarks or three down quarks this is not

a neutron this doesn't this is not a

neutron or proton this is a new object

which is a little bit more massive than

a proton or neutron it has a name it's

called a delta

it has ISO spin three halves and it has

spin three halves so it's sometimes

called the Delta three halves

it has both ISO spin and spin three

halves

let's forget it's spin it spins it just

aligned if we line them up all along the

z axis then they're all aligned let's

forget that what about this can this be

all there is to an ISO spin three half

state how many states does it does a

spin three halves object have four right

so there must be two more and there are

two more there are two more Delta 3 half

States two more of them and two more are

u UD + UD d for States for objects all

which are related by symmetries they all

have very close to the same mass the

only thing which distinguishes their

mass is the little small difference

between masses of up and down quarks and

they're all very similar to each other

I'm telling you this for a reason this

said this played an important historical

role and I'm going to tell you about in

a moment

these four states are called the Delta

three-halves and what's that charges

let's go through their charges what's

the charge of this one since the

symmetry that you you need give you all

right let's look at the charges button

that's wait what the third one done

what's the mystery that the proton ah

steady spinning spinning that's finished

we have not spin one-half okay the I

systems Z campano it has it's part of

the multiplet which is an ISO spin

three-halves object okay right ISO spin

three-halves right so as both spin and I

suspend three-halves but by looking at

these two you couldn't tell that you

have to know sorry you have to know a

bit more about the nature of the way

they're combined all right but they have

a component of ISO spin just as the

analog of the Z component of spin would

be one half but the full isotopic spin

would be three halves yeah remember

every object which has a spin three

halves comes in four states four states

here they are one half one half minus

three-halves minus three-halves same is

true for ISO spin okay but let's

concentrate on spin for a moment these

two states they

that's these two and the ones of maximum

and minimum spin that's these two so

it's got to be four of them we know that

a thing with spin three-halves has four

states z-component devices spin can be

1/2 and minus 1/2 but by analogy we'll

ordinary spin there will have to be four

of them ok but let's let's come to the

to the importance points let's first of

all label their charges this one has

three charge 2/3 object it has charge to

this one has charge minus 1 + u UD has

charge plus 1 + charge what is this 1 0

so the charges are different well these

two do have the same charges sorry did I

get this right u UD no yeah yeah yeah

these do happen to have the same charge

as proton and neutron but these are

different okay all four of these objects

have to within a small discrepancy the

same mass just as the proton and neutron

have the same mass these have the same

mass but that mass is not the same as

the proton and neutron proton and

neutron the mass is about 940 in units

of MeV zillions of electron volts this

is the mass of the proton and neutron

with the neutron being slightly heavy

and not by much

okay the mass of the Delta

is about 1200 MeV the Delta can decay it

can decay into a proton and neutron and

a PI on let's just see how that would

work let's take the easy ones the easy

ones have all three quarks the same up

up up so here we have three up quarks

moving along and how can that decay what

does it was it going to decay into it's

going to decay into a proton and new or

neutron and a MS on Amazon is a quark

antiquark pair let me just draw a have

for you how this happens this would be

up up up the two up quarks go off this

up quark also goes off but quarks can

separate like that quark and an

antiquark appear in between like that

the quark and the antiquark in between

could either be a down quark or an up

quark so one possibility is that this is

another up quark and then this would be

an anti up quark and this would be an up

quark an up quark and an antiquark have

zero charge this would be the decay of

the Delta three-halves what do we have

here this one no this one can't happen

this one actually can't decay not

possible we have to put it down quark

here there's just not enough energy for

it to happen this would be an anti down

quark and an up quark so what would this

thing be up up and down that would be a

proton the proton is lighter than the

Delta so there's enough leftover energy

how much energy is left over

let's see 260 MeV about right something

like that 300 MeV roughly 300 MeV what's

the mass of a pi on about 140 about 140

MeV so there's enough energy for this to

happen and still leave over some kinetic

energy for the PI on to fly away what

kind of pie on is this with an up in a

down bar

what's its charge 2/3 and 1/3 so this is

a pie plus and a proton total charge to

this is the object with charge - so

these Delta objects are not stable they

all can decay into a proton or neutron

and a pion and they're very short-lived

their lifetime we could work out the

numerical I'll tell you what their

lifetime is order of magnitude order of

magnitude it's the time that light would

take to cross the proton so you can

figure out that the proton is about ten

to the minus thirteen centimeters what's

the speed of light that 10 to the 10th

centimeters per second so ten to the

minus twenty third seconds or something

they don't last long

but they do last long enough to be

identifiable as distinct objects when

they produce these deltas

these deltas and collisions particle

collisions Delta's are produced and

they're real objects but they are very

very short-lived scheme as a matter of

notation is making it if this which

ordered

no not enough not for purposes here no

[Music]

okay that's exactly what we have to come

to now there's something wrong here

something's rotten in the state of

Denmark what is it well we have three up

quarks whose spins are all in the same

direction we could put those spins we

could if we like choose those spins to

be all up and make a delta three-halves

with its spin ordinary spin up with all

three in the same direction and they'd

all be three up quarks you're not

allowed to put two fermions in the same

state ah if if you could fiddle around

with the spin maybe you could do

something with a spin but all the three

spins are the same why are they the same

because it has spin three-halves three

quarks with spin three-halves have the

same spin they also have the same ISO

spin namely they're all up quarks so we

seem to have found an object which

consists of three identical up quarks

that's a violation of the principle that

you cannot put two fermions into the

same state this was the clue that led

eventually to what is called quantum

chromodynamics

it was realized that quarks have to have

another property they must have another

property or so that the three quarks in

the Delta three-halves can be different

from each other

the fermion statistics the fermionic

property of them requires that they be

the

friend so there must be a label another

label that was hidden from view for some

reason which um which is there but not

apparent and experiments that label is

called color color is again highly

arbitrary term it has nothing whatever

to do with ordinary color and it was

just a label - - a name a name different

in different places the three colors of

quarks are different in some places

they're red white and blue mostly in the

southern parts of the United States

other places are red green and blue red

green and blue being the primary colors

of light up that you see with your eyes

I will use red green and blue I haven't

heard red white and blue being used for

a long time

not for the last nine years or so but

they're just labels they're just labels

and in no sense of a physically

different one from another and any sort

of interesting measurable way the fact

that there are three distinct ones and

that they are that they are not the same

is important they have exactly the same

mass they have exactly the same

properties so let's now write down what

we know about the the labeling of quarks

all the various quirks we know about

there are up quarks down quarks so

that's the lightest one then there are

charm quarks strange quarks and after

charm comes top quarks and bottom quarks

they're not listed in order of mass the

up is the lightest the down is next the

charm is much heavier than the strange

by a factor of about eight or something

like that and the top is vastly heavier

than the bottom but I've just put them

in I've been perverse and put up on top

of down I don't know why these are the

six distinct types of quarks but now for

each type of quark

there is another label so quarks are

labeled by two labels and the two labels

are red green and blue as I said I don't

want anybody to think they're really red

green and blue but that's the label and

where did that come from how did we know

it was there well it's one of these

things where physicists simply followed

their noses they simply said look

there's something wrong with this quark

model you can't have three quarks all in

the same state they must differ by

something else now they could differ by

position but it was known that for one

reason or another that it didn't have to

do with position and momentum that was

that was known to be irrelevant for

dynamical reasons for energetic reasons

so that was not the issue there were

three quarks all in the same state they

must have it in fact the situation was

actually quite similar to what happened

in atomic physics spin was discovered by

unum back in gouts MIT because of the

because of atomic spectroscopy helium

had two electrons in the same state no

good violates the the Pauli principle

well actually the timing here I think

may be a little bit confused but it

could have worked this way they could

have said well paui tells us that you

can't put two things in that maybe it

did work that I can't remember now I

wasn't around I don't remember but the

reason or one of the reasons that gouts

mitten olam BEC might have since I

the history in detail might have

invented spin was because in the helium

atom there were two electrons apparently

in the same orbital state so you've got

to attach to the hill to the electron

another quantum number another label and

at work that works just fine it worked a

second time history repeated itself and

various people Nambu Nambu was the one

who realized this your chair on Nambu

Nambu japanese physicist japanese

american physicist the Nambu realized

that this called for another quantum

number and he said every quark has to

have another degree of freedom i don't

think he called it color i suspect that

was Gelman but i'm not sure many a good

time good deal later and then what he

said is look Oh what's going on here is

that you put three quarks together one

red one green and one blue and now

you're in business

no more violation of the Heisenberg

uncertainty principle the same trick

incidentally works for protons and

neutrons are that you can understand the

proton and neutron also as a red

ultimate what I call is again red green

and blue yes question

so is there physical property that you

measure or no no in every possible way

they are the same except we know there

are three distinct ones so if you had

one you could tell the other why and

anything you say if you say that maybe

the crystals in the five Richard huh if

you can't to take the difference right

you can see if you have one you can tell

the other one is different other that's

that's that's a little bit complicated

and in collisions you can tell that if

you have one if you have two of them you

can tell that they can't be the same

in arctic observed the colors in the

action you have well yeah the color is

conserved but it's also always zero it's

not only conserved but it's always zero

so it's a little bit funny conservation

law but look you could say the same

thing about it doesn't quite tell you

that you need all three of the colors

for a uue game no but you need do need

something to distinguish the two use

yeah it gives you more than you need

that's why that's why I historically the

Delta three-halves played an important

role it was looking at this guy here

which was unambiguous three quarks

parallel spin parallel iso spin

something's wrong it would have been

possible to analyze the protons and

neutrons but it would have been less

convincing when the Delta three-halves

was interpreted in terms of quarks that

really hit you over the head that so the

ultimate resolution is and then we now

know you know really experimentally

extremely well with the three quarks

that three different kinds of colors are

really there you know even with ordinary

spin what's the difference between spin

up this way and spin that way there's no

difference they have exactly the same

property all you have to do is turn your

head over Oh spin this way unless you'll

have another one to set a direction or

something to set a direction then then

you can't tell the difference between

them on the other hand if you have some

object which picks out a direction and

you bring a spin up to it you can tell

whether the spin is a long a particular

axis or not in the same way if you have

a proton a proton being different than a

neutron

and proton and the neutron are

identifiable objects I mean in

laboratory if you have a proton it picks

out a direction in this isoh spin state

space it's up in the ISO spin direction

not down and if you have another quark

you can discover whether that quark is

power has its ISO spin parallel to or

anti parallel to the proton so yes you

can tell not at ISO spin you can tell

whether it's I said something wrong but

close enough if you have one object it

can provide a kind of frame of reference

for the other ones and test whether

they're the same or not but the

mathematics of quantum chromodynamics

simply requires that that you have these

three different things you could say

maybe it's a violation of the poly

principle you could there's no known

mathematical framework for discussing

that and there's no quantum field theory

that has anything but fermions and

bosons so you'd have to be Vincent Lee

knew

mentor position and you can make a case

that ice has been is a kind of observer

absolutely what would be a totally

observable much much more subtle much

more subtle much more subtle let's come

back to it I'll tell you we get there

after we've talked a little bit about I

just have the same session in a

different form if you have a down up of

a proton

one of them one of the three quarks is

green and since the down there's only

one of I mean the question the question

is how can you really associate with one

color with one of the rocks

no you have to think of quantum

superpositions of states so you might

write let's take the case of the proton

up down down this could be green red

blue but we have to write all

possibilities all ways of combining them

and to make a real proton so we have to

use some quantum mechanics to symmetrize

the wave functions and so forth

symmetrize anti symmetries them

appropriately but the the big advantage

of this Delta three-halves you didn't

have to do anything fancy just three all

in the same direction no okay um sure

you could say well maybe there was

something wrong with our ideas about

quantum field theory but by now

the theory of quantum chromodynamics

which is exactly baked chromel has to do

with color color is the important

quantity in quantum chromodynamics just

like charge is the important quantity in

an electrodynamics this theory is a

highly accurate description of

experimental data associated with the

collision of patrons and its accuracy is

you know way beyond what can be

questioned now so the ultimate answer is

that it works okay now let's talk about

gluons the missing ingredient now we

have the analog of electrons the quarks

the fermions they have some attributes

they have some electric charge like

electrons they stick together not quite

the way electrons stick to a nucleus

perhaps a little more the way electrons

stick to positrons but they stick

together somehow what's missing is what

sticks them together what sticks

together atoms is the electrostatic

field the electrostatic field is

associated with photons we can either

think of it in field language that every

electron creates a field around it all

we can think of it in particle language

that electrons emit and absorb photons

the exchange of photons back and forth

between charged particles creates the

the forces between them what about

quarks what sticks them together

particle very very similar to the two

the photon at first it was a speculation

maybe such objects exist then a theory

was built a mathematical theory was

built with quarks and gluons gluons

being the analog of photons they're very

similar to photons they have spin one

just like the photon

which means they have the same kind of

polarization states they're massless

like photons very similar but with one

big difference that will come through

and they jump back and forth or they go

on one hand a quark is a source of the

field that's associated with gluons the

gluon field in the same sense that the

electron is the source of the

electromagnetic field on the other hand

not the other hand but a similar hand

the quarks can emit and absorb gluons

what are gluons like what quantities do

gluons have photons are pretty in a

certain sense uninteresting except for

the fact that they have a polarization

they have a spin and they have a

polarization they have a momentum and

they have a polarization and that's

about all they don't have any charge by

itself a photon if it collides with

another Photon there are no forces now

that's not exactly true there are forces

between photons but there's secondary

effects they're not electrostatic forces

because the photon is charged there are

secondary effects which come from

quantum electrodynamics and loops of

quantum complicated finding diagrams

involving electrons but the primordial

interaction between photons is there is

none they move freely past each other

and that's why a beam of light moving in

one direction will pass over pass

through a beam of light moving in the

other direction with no interaction

Excelsior in some material

okay so photons are not very interesting

and in the sense that they don't

interact with each other they are

interesting from the point of view of

their interaction with electrons and

basically all of quantum electrodynamics

is summarized by one diagram and that

diagram which we've drawn several times

is the emission of a photon

from an electron electrons are drawn as

having a directionality the direction

along which the charge is moving you can

flip lines around and every time you see

an arrow going downward that indicates a

pro a positron but it's all one basic

vertex that's it and out of that you can

build forces you can build collisions

everything else all right just for the

purposes are from bookkeeping think of a

photon as having the same charge as an

electron and a positron in fact a photon

if it's given a hit and given a little

extra energy can decay into an electron

and a positron it's not that in any

sense of photon is made of an electron

and a positron that's not the point but

it happens to have the same properties

as an electron and a positron in

particular it's electric charge it also

has a angular momentum it has a spin a

spin of 1 and with an electron and

positron if you line up their spins you

can also make a spin of one so in many

ways a photon is similar to an electron

and a positron that sometimes indicated

by drawing by thinking of the photon as

a fictitious composite of an electron

and a positron and then this diagram

this diagram of the emission of a photon

can be drawn just by saying the electron

comes along becomes an electron over

here the electron over here was really a

positron moving backward which turned

around now there's no content in this

other than to say without losing any

electric charge you can emit a photon

and you can see it directly you don't

really certainly don't need this to see

that an electron can emit a photon and

that there's no violation of

conservation that's totally obvious that

an electron can emit an electrically

neutral thing but nevertheless let's

just draw the emission of a photon by

thinking of the photon as a composite of

an electron and positron it's it's not

useful for electrodynamics the analog is

quite useful for quantum chromodynamics

okay now let's come to quarks electrons

we're finished with and the important

thing in quantum chromodynamics is the

color so let's begin with quarks quarks

can be red green or blue let's make a

column vector out of them and use the

language of quantum mechanics a quark

can either be in the red state the green

state or the blue state and make a

column out of it an anti quark let's

represent anti quarks by red bar green

bar and blue bar a gluon first of all a

gluon is an object that can be emitted

by a quark if this is a quark and a cork

goes off a gluon can be emitted but the

interesting thing is the gluon behaves

in some respects like a quark and an

antiquark it's not a quark and an

antiquark I'll tell you precisely in

what sense it behaves like a quark and

an antiquark but let's think of the

gluon as a quark and an antiquark in the

same way so how do we label if we label

each quark by a color this now becomes a

quark and an antiquark quark and an

antiquark how many different kinds of

quarks and antiquarks are there what

did I hear nine yeah you're almost right

right the logic was what I was looking

for I wanted you to say nine there's a

subtlety there's a subtlety which will

come to there really only eight but but

let's say nine to begin with

what are those nine quarks well I

started one of those nine gluons then

the nine combinations that you can make

by taking a quark and an antiquark in

other words they make a matrix if quarks

are like a column then and we might

think of just for fun we might think of

anti quarks as making a row red bar

green bar blue bar then gluons would

fill out a matrix all right in other

words to label a gluon you would label

it with two indices two colors and what

would they be there would be red red bar

red green bar red blue bar green red bar

green green bar green blue bar what else

PR bar be G bar be P bar

to the diagonal

sit again

well the diagonal elements are not

really indistinguishable but the but the

point is that the sum of the diagonal

elements is is not an independent

quantum state all right so it would seem

like there are nine gluons later on we

will talk about a particular subtle PE

which tells us the quantum mechanical

superposition of red red bar plus green

green bar plus blue blue bar is our

nothing doesn't exist but for now for

our purposes right now let's neglect

that there are really only eight gluons

but it really does look from this

pattern here that there should be nine

so let's let's play with it as if there

were nine then what kind of Fineman

diagrams can exist well a quark can

become another kind of quark and emit a

gluon all right so let's draw the

diagram for that let's take the case of

a red quark becoming a green quark and

emitting a gluon what kind of blowing

gets emitted red green bar

where's red green bar here right here

red-green bar and if you like you can

draw that with a neat notation the

notation is just a bookkeeping device

really and here it's useful here it

really is useful just think of the red

is going through and the green also is

going through except when you flip the

green line over it becomes an anti green

and a red so the gluon that's emitted is

as if the red just went through and the

green annihilated a green bar that's the

basic vertex of quantum chromodynamics

there's not just one of them there were

nine of them or are actually only eight

but but the pattern is quark goes to

another kind of quark and gluon is

emitted if a red cork goes to a red

quark then it's a red red bar if a red

cork goes to a blue quark then it's a

red blue bar and so forth and so on okay

now that's as I said the basic the basic

phenomenon or the basic primitive

building block of quantum chromodynamics

you can build all sorts of sorry that's

a half that's one of the building blocks

there is another building block that

isn't there for quantum electrodynamics

as I said photons don't interact with

each other in particular a photon can't

emit a photon and another photon

electron can emit a photon and stay an

electron photons don't emit photons so

photons don't interact with each other

in any way except in materials yeah

gluons are only in the

with a change in port no they can no you

can have I don't require I mean about

this process and whether it change the

weather does not change SS this is the

only method aware which one that's right

this is the only way in which gluons are

emitted but there is something new that

makes quantum chromodynamics first of

all far more complicated and far more

interesting than electrodynamics let's

take a gluon moving along here's a gluon

let's see let's take that glue on to be

a red blue bar glue on that's a red blue

bar glue on okay now can this happen I'm

going to show you something that yes is

really part of quantum chromodynamics

maybe it's not too surprising once I

draw it this is not really a quark but

just imagine it's a fictitious quark

making up the glue on all right

fictitious quark goes off well if it's a

fictitious quark it better not really go

off but we'll see in a moment what

happens to it and the blue bar keeps

going but now if these really work works

a quark and an antiquark could form what

kind of quark antiquark ooh would you

like to put there green

let's put green there this would be

green going this way and this would be

anti green going this way and this would

be red so red goes through blue bar goes

through and green becomes anti green

going that way well what do we have now

now we have a basic vertex in which

three gluons come together let's draw

gluons as wavy lines similar to the

photons we now have a vertex

in which a red blue bar becomes a red

green bar and a green blue bar we don't

really have to remember what

combinations are possible all we have to

do is figure out which diagrams we can

draw where all of the lines go through

without being interrupted you can figure

out what the various couplings or what

the various possible fundamental

diagrams there are connecting gluons

this is the new thing what it means is

that gluons interact with each other

gluons exert forces on gluons in a way

that would be unthinkable for photons

photons cannot exchange photons between

them gluons can exchange gluons between

them so now let's come to forces the

gluon behaves in a way which is similar

to the photon and that's something which

is similar to what the photon does it

can be exchanged here's a diagram it's

easy to draw diagrams where quarks

interact with each other

all right let's let's draw yeah let's

draw a diagram in which an anti quark

interacts with a quark all right here's

a blue bar anti quark which emits a blue

bar green gluon becomes a green blue arm

and now the green glow on the green

Werth sorry let's see this would be a

green bar this would be a blue green bar

glue on his green bar is blue but let's

say that blue goes right through like

that and what do we have here we have

here now an exchange of a

one between a blue bar and a blue making

a green bar and a green that's a kind of

force between quarks that creates a

force between quarks in very much the

same way that photons exchanged between

electrons create forces oh you might

want to make a force between a blue bar

and blue bar supposing we wanted force

between a blue bar and a blue then we

would make this blue bar here alright so

we can make all sorts of forces this way

but what about forces between gluons all

we have to do to this diagram is add an

extra two lines let's what did I have

this originally um blue bar let's make

it blue bar green bar up here green up

here let's put another line in here it's

not another quark now it's really going

to be representing a gluon and this one

let's take to be red red goes right

through let's put another line over here

I don't know what that I take that one

to be I think I took that one to be blue

bar blue bar this is now a diagram which

represents the exchange of a gluon

between two gluons this is really

something new this is something very

very different than electrodynamics what

does it lead to

it leads to forces between gluons quarks

can bind together because of the

exchange of gluons and make hadrons

but gluons can bind together and make

objects there are objects in quantum

chromodynamics which contain no quarks

there are no bound are no bound States

composite objects in quantum

electrodynamics just made up out of

photons

there are objects which are just made up

out of gluons and how do they happen

they happen because gluons can exchange

gluons back and forth we could just

summarize this by saying there's a force

due to the exchange of gluons between

gluons this would also mean for example

that if you had two waves of gluons

going past each other they would

interact with each other they would

deform each other they wouldn't just go

through each other just like two

electromagnetic waves in fact even if

you had a single gluon wave moving along

the different parts of it would exert

forces on each other and cause it to

deform or do whatever it might do so the

watchword is that the dynamics of gluons

is nonlinear yeah do you have the same

degrees you just have to make sure the

lines follow through the diagram

uninterrupted well that's what this

that's what they're following the lines

means where did I draw this wrong I

might have drawn oh sorry this should be

green bar this should be green bar Green

a green bar yeah sorry the rule is

follow the lines when a line turns

around in time like that change it to an

anti particle and that's basically the

only rule of quantum chromodynamics that

there are interactions between quarks

and gluons and they they satisfy the

let's call it the follow the line rule

all right and there are interactions

between gluons and gluons and they also

follow the line

any color problem in our genes what's he

wear our g o5 r d RB bar this should be

B bar in equity G know where it should

be feed bar left I'm going this way

this one should be G and this one should

be P bar okay let's draw let's do it

over wrap sorry I messed it up that way

enough to do it over

okay so I think I have blue bar over

here red if I remember I don't remember

red goes through so it stays red blue

bar goes over here and then turns around

so this must be blue this one was blue

bar has to be a quark and an antiquark

blue bar straight through blue bar here

and now we have our choice what we want

to put over here so I think I put green

going this way green green green bar

green goes right through the diagram

okay now I think it makes sense

every line just go straight through red

go straight through that way blue bar

goes straight through this way well we

can put the arrow the other way to

indicate ant that particle

yeah yeah gluons always have the

properties of quark antiquark earlier by

analogy with the photon she said the

gluons are massless yeah these diagrams

with olie still they are masters we're

going to come to what meaning of the

mass of a quark and a gluon are all

right yes they are massless in a

technical and special sense I'll tell

you right now with the special senses

we're going to quit in a minute or two

in fact right now I'll give you an

example we're going to come we're going

to study this theory one more one more

week and we're going to talk about the

confinement of quark so we're going to

talk about the structure of hadron x'

and so forth

but let me just tell you in what sense a

quark or a gluon does or does not have a

mass or does or does not have the mass

that we ascribe to it so let me imagine

that I have a object of mass M a small

object of mass M and the small object of

mass M has attached to it a I don't know

what it is it's whatever you want it to

be some sort of Wiggly soft the piece of

chewing gum or something that dangles

off it now I want to move this object if

I move the object with a very small

force the force being so small that it

doesn't deform that the acceleration is

so slow that the whole thing moves off

together what kind of mass does it have

the answer is it has the mass of

whatever you put here plus the mass of

the

a lot of chewing gum or whatever it

happens to be we're thinking now purely

non relativistically just to give you an

analogy on the other hand supposing I

shake this thing with a very high

frequency and I ask what are the

properties of the motion of the of the

core of it over here

when it's been subjected to a very very

high frequency force of some sort what

kind of mass does it have over here just

the mass of this object alone

right the rest of it doesn't have time

to to adjust to the other forces it just

stands still now maybe this sends out a

wave all right but the very rapid

oscillation here the response of this in

here would be the response of an object

of mass M so what is the mass of it is

it the mass of the sum of them or is it

the mass of the thing at the end

the answer is ill-defined the answer

depends on the frequency of the force

that you that you exert on it masses of

objects are frequency dependent or well

in the sense in this sense the the mass

of this object the observed mass of it

that the that would respond with would

depend on the frequency of the motion in

the same sense the mass of a quark is

frequency dependent if you shake a quark

is some kind of object inside a hadron

there are three of them and there's a

bunch of mushy gluons stuff in there

holding them together if you were to try

to move the quark by itself but if you

were trying to move the quark slowly if

you grab the whole of that quark if you

could do so and you moved it very slowly

the whole thing would drag along and

what would be the mass of it what would

be the mass you would experience mass of

the whole thing which could be the mass

of the proton which is nine hundred and

thirtysomething or others

what about if you were to exert a very

high frequency force on it well I'm not

going to tell you what well the answer

would be what we normally call the mass

of the quark that's this 5 or 10 MeV for

an up-or-down core up or down quark so

the mass of the quark 1 is subjected to

a very very high frequency only when

it's hit very hard and you try to see

how it flies off dragging this other

stuff behind it the initial impulse that

it gets and the initial velocity that

goes off with will be sensitive to the

to one value of the mass on the other

hand if you hit it very slowly with a

very gentle low-frequency force the

whole thing would move off so the

concept of what is the mass of a quark

is somewhat ambiguous are and to keep

the discussion simple let's say the mass

that we usually ascribe to the fourth or

the quark are these high frequency

responses analogous to to the mass at

the end of the wall of julyan not really

this is a completely client in this case

this is a completely classical

phenomenon that you have a small little

nut at the end of a Wiggly

something-or-other you shake it very

rapidly you see it accelerates with one

kind of acceleration you accelerate it

with a low frequency it absorbs that's a

classical phenomena does not have to do

with the last actually describe the

electric charge charge like yeah yes yes

yes yes lesson but that's exactly right

the lesson is the parameters that we

describe particles with are dependent on

frequencies and wavelengths of the

interactions that they engage in

they're called running

yeah oh is that the same story pause it

does it does we have to sort out exactly

what we mean by the charger or quirk but

let's just put it this way it's

one-third the charge of a proton but yes

you're right we do have to define it

carefully and that's a whole story into

itself that's a big question right I

don't know that's what we're going to

talk about we go that's next right back

yeah this stuff works here it's so hard

with the fractional choices and Carter

question this and that because you can

look at individual products how did

people figure this out oh that took time

[Music]

yeah well there was a number of clues

there were a number of clues by the time

I came into physics the idea of quarks

was already established I mean by

nineteen I was a graduate student in

1963 when Murray gell-mann announced the

idea of quarks so and I dunno how he

came to it but but the there were clues

there are a lot of clues there were a

lot of clues but there were also a lot

of inconsistencies so it was a pattern

of suggestion suggestive facts together

with apparent inconsistencies such as

the violation of Fermi statistics and

and there was another fact which was

very peculiar the other fact there will

come through next time had to do with

the fact that works are never produced

in the laboratory that they're always

permanently confined inside protons

neutrons massan's

that was another fact and it wasn't one

person who put it together was a whole

variety of people who put the whole

thing together Nambu had the right idea

in the early 60s he had the right idea

but the whole thing got put together and

you know nailed in place and the whole

structure was put together over a period

of 10 years yeah we will talk about that

yes this theory is ignoring electrons

now just like in quantum electrodynamics

we ignore quarks I only have to put them

together we have to put them together

into some coherent thing in which quarks

and electrons and photons and all of

them form one bigger structure some of

which has been done and some of it has

not been so yeah it is a process of

isolating I mean physics always works

that where you isolate do you you know

you divide and conquer and then you have

to put it all together ok good let's say
