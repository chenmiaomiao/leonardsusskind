Stanford University yeah all right so

let's let's just for a moment stop and

say what we'll do next time I'm not sure

whether tonight I will get to one of the

key puzzles which is called the gauge

hierarchy we may I had planned it in my

notes and we may get to it especially

since I'm getting rid of the review but

next quarter I want to study some of

these paradoxes not paradoxes but

difficulties of the theory and how

things like supersymmetry relate to them

how supersymmetry may or may not solve

some of these puzzling features of the

theory how unification what unification

right now we have su 3 we have su 2 and

we have u 1 I'm talking now about the

forces weak electromagnetic and strong

do these somehow sit in some bigger

structure is there a group for example

which contains the subgroups su 3 su 2

as a new one I haven't told you what a

subgroup is but you can imagine is there

a bigger structure a bigger mathematical

structure that contains su 3 su 2 and

you won yes there's a subgroup there's a

group called su 5 and there's a lot of

interesting evidence that this whole

structure that I've described so far

fits very very neatly into an su 5

structure in which quarks and leptons

are all part of the same multiplets

we'll talk about that supersymmetry

unification and the various puzzles that

arise and I will tell you a little bit

about what LHC has cooked up to discover

all right now one thing that LHC was

cooked up originally to discover was of

course the Higgs boson the Higgs boson

discovering the Higgs boson is not just

the scar

during the higgs-boson for example less

that's more than just discovering the

existence of a particle it's also

involves a whole bunch of properties of

this particle which are all related to

the fact that it is a Higgs boson for

example I told you though I think those

last time how the Higgs boson and the

Higgs phenomena is related to the masses

of fermions we looked at the Dirac

equation instead of looking at the Dirac

equation we might have looked at the

lagrangian for the Dirac equation I

don't know if we ever wrote down the

Lagrangian for the Dirac equation I

don't think we did let me write it down

for you yeah we did the klein-gordon let

me write it down for you it's it's very

easy we first write down the Dirac

equation derivative with respect to X nu

of about derivative with respect to time

of psy was a minus a plus I don't

remember plus derivative with respect to

X sub i where X sub I means X Y or Z

times alpha I Sai we can put the Alpha I

out here and we set that equal to what

beta times the mass right I'm sorry that

was the Dirac equation let me move

everything over to the left hand side

but I ever tell you my great my greatest

mathematical discovery you don't need

the equal sign right right you made that

discovery - how old are you oh I told

you okay okay this is the Dirac equation

now supposing I want to derive this

Dirac equation by variation with respect

to something in particular it happens to

be size stars that you vary with respect

to well it's a very easy way of

constructing a Lagrangian such that when

you vary with respect to size star its

the Dirac equation which Pro falls out

all you have to do is multiply the Dirac

equation by size star so I go else I

star now it's not right now it's not

zero it's still zero but but now it is

not the Dirac equation it's the

lagrangian for the Dirac field all right

what does it have in it it has terms

side dagger derivatives of sigh those

are the kinds of things which move a

particle from one point to another

remember in the klein-gordon equation

the kinetic term was associated with the

hopping of the particle from one point

to another and that's what these terms

are it absorbs a particle and moves it

to a new point of space-time that's what

the derivatives do they move it to a new

point of space-time at the same time

they jiggle its spin in a certain way

that's that's what these kinetic things

are and the mass term is just a term

which takes a particle absorbs it and

emits it from a point of space with no

derivatives at all it doesn't it doesn't

what really absorbs it and emits it from

the same spot

that's the Lagrangian for the Dirac

equation and it's yeah

no no no okay

all right so you asked me I hadn't used

that language but I will now use that

language now good just for those who are

curious about the more covariant

language if you take side dagger and you

multiply it by beta that gives you

something that's called a side bar if if

you want to get back from side bar -

sigh you multiply by beta

why because beta squared is equal to 1

all right so you can write this you can

rewrite this in the following way you

write it as side bar beta that's just

side dagger D by DT and then over here

what we have then we will have plus side

bar beta alpha sub I derivative with

respect to X sub I sigh and then what

about this one over here sorry let's put

the yeah this one is going to be side

dagger beta M sigh what will that be no

no it's just sy bar m sy m sy bar m m

plus m sy bar side now if I change the

name of these symbols we can call beta

gamma naught why not because it's

connected with not usually refers to

time the for coordinates of space time

are the zero component for time and one

two three four space so this one's

usually called gamma naught beta is

sometimes called the factor most

frequently in modern physics the Alpha

Beta notation is mostly abandoned and

you use gamma so this becomes

sy bar gamma

not DT sigh and this one now we're going

to change the name beta times alpha just

the product beta times alpha I we're

going to call gamma I sidebar gamma I di

sy + m sy bar si that's the Lagrangian

and now it has a very very neat form you

can think of gamma naught D by DT is

being gamma naught D by D X naught this

is gamma I D by DXi it looks like a nice

covariant sort of for vector product of

gamma matrices times derivatives in

other words you can write the whole

thing in the form sy bar gamma mu D by

DX mu let's just call it D by D mu now

mu goes from 1 to 4 plus m sy okay

that's that's much more elegant than the

original form that there a croak down

these are also the alphas and betas are

called Dirac matrices the gammas are

also called Dirac matrices yeah you said

the sine of the far left here with Sylar

and you didn't Barnes

all right by me all you have to remember

though is that side bar is not side

dagger its side dagger with an extra

gamma naught all right but this is the

this is the elegant form for the

equation in fact side bar sigh happens

to be a scalar and side bar gamma psy is

a four vector it has an index mule so

this is this is a more elegant way to

present the Dirac equation there Dirac

Lagrangian the Dirac equation is just

setting this equal to zero okay

Dirac Lagrangian looks like this now

from this point of view let's just

examine well let's examine the various

terms you know there's a fifth Dirac

matrix anybody know what it's called

gimmefive what's missing gamma 4 there's

no gamma 4 in fact it's just a glitch is

another there's one more gamma matrix

which is called gamma 5 which happens to

be the product of gamma north gamma 1

gamma 2 gamma 3

it's called gamma 5 it happens to be one

more matrix and in fact the eigenvectors

of gamma 5 gamma 5 squared is also equal

to 1 it has two eigenvalues plus 1 and

minus 1 and the two eigen vectors are

the two eigenvalues correspond to the

left handedness on the right handedness

of the other particles gamma 5 is called

Gila City chirality excuse me chirality

handedness Cairo 4 han eunok like a kite

what it was the Greek word for hand

Chiron Cairo's Chiron something with a

Chi RCIA Chir chirality yah gamma 5 is

called chirality and it can be plus or

minus one

and it corresponds to the handedness of

the two particles now if you work it out

if you work out the various things

you'll find that this term here does not

couple the left-handed in the

right-handed components of side the

left-handed and right-handed components

of sigh mean the things will I gain

value plus one and minus one for gamma

five but just think of them as electrons

or particles where the right-hand did

the Atilla city or left-handed he'll a

city these two here sorry these four

here do not multiply left-handed times

right-handed it just happens they don't

can work that out from the by yourselves

this one does sidebar times I happens to

be it can happens to be right this way

happens to be sine dagger left side

right plus side dagger right side left

that's what it is so the mass turn here

mixes up the left-handed and the

right-handed particles that's what a

mass is a Dirac masses it's a term in

the Lagrangian seems weird that it

should have anything to do with with

inertia

it's a term which causes a left-handed

Fermi on to flip to a right-handed Fermi

on to flip to a left-handed Fermi on and

so forth and that's what's over here the

other terms don't do that so that means

a massless fermion as a definite

chirality the mass term flips the

chirality back and forth and back and

forth yeah all right then we talked

about a class of interactions the weak

interactions let's put them particular

focus on the Z the emission and

absorption of Z bosons that is purely

left-handed for some odd reason for some

odd reason are the Z boson only is

emitted by left-handed particles not by

right-handed particles this is not true

of the photon this is only true of the Z

boson sorry the W boson Z boson is a

little more kinky at the but has a

symmetric couplings to the left-handed

and right-handed but let's focus on the

double use they couple throw only the

left-handed degrees of freedom so that

means that in effect with respect to the

charges with respect to the

transformation properties under the su

to the su 2 that's connected with a WB

with the emission of W bosons the

left-handed fermion is charged and the

right-handed fermion is uncharged you're

not allowed

to put in a Lagrangian something like

this which would take a charged particle

to an uncharged particles would mean a

process in which any charged particle we

come in and get absorbed an uncharged

particles go out violates charge

conservation so this would not be a

legal term in a Lagrangian that have a

um a gauge symmetry which only coupled

to left-handed particles all right then

the question is how do you get a mass

for fermions we know that electrons and

quarks they all have masses there's

something wrong ah here's where the

Higgs boson comes into play the Higgs

boson also plays the role of a charged

object with respect to the SU 2 of weak

interactions in fact it's a doublet just

like the electron and neutrino are

doublets the Higgs boson is also a

doublet I didn't emphasize that and I'm

not going to emphasize it I sort of

skirted around it ah the Higgs boson

also transforms under SU 2 and roughly

speaking the way to make this into a

legitimate interaction is to multiply by

the appropriate Higgs boson field here

the Higgs boson if you like carries

carries a weak charge which is either

the same or opposite depending on which

component we're talking about as the as

the weak charge of let's say the

electron if we're talking about

electrons here the right-handed particle

has no charge with respect to with

respect to the weak interactions so what

we have to do is put a Higgs boson here

and a Higgs dagger here

this means the emission of a Higgs boson

and the emission of a hand anti Higgs

boson if you like with the Higgs boson

carrying off the charge of the

left-handed particle when it became the

right-handed part

so we introduced into the into the

Lagrangian something which takes a left

handed Fermi on emits a right handed

from yarn but also allows a Higgs boson

to be emitted in such a way that the

weak charge of the electron or the quark

or whatever it is

escapes in the form of the Higgs boson

the Higgs doublet and that would be the

end of the story

except for the spontaneous symmetry

breaking which has to do with the Higgs

field getting an expectation value the

Higgs field well I think we call the

file ass time didn't we I think we call

the fie let's just continue to call it

Phi or we made a 5 particle here that

would be the end of the story except

that for whatever reasons nature has

chosen the energetics of the Higgs field

that's fine here to have one of these

Mexican hat potential energies why did

it do that

why did nature do that we don't know

okay but we're very lucky that it did

otherwise chemistry would go to hell and

things would be very very unpleasant but

with one of these upside down Mexican

hat potentials that means that Phi is

equal to a number just a magnitude of

the Higgs field here which we called f

plus a fluctuation a fluctuation away

from that value and that fluctuation is

what we actually call the Higgs field

all right so let's go back now what

happens to this term what happens to

these terms in the Lagrangian they break

up into two pieces

not these two pieces but these two

pieces

one of them is yo I left out one thing

what did I leave out of this expression

a numerical moment number G you kow a

coupling let's call it G sub y and

there's a different G sub y for each

Fermi on these two should be the same

all right G sub y is just a number a

pure number carries no dimensions they

called you color couplings and where

they came from I don't know somebody

wiser than me put them into the

Lagrangian okay so here they are

alright now let's use the fact that Phi

is equal to a non fluctuating part which

we call f for the non fluctuating part

we call it f don't and for the

fluctuating part we call that H the

higgs-boson

that's not my notation that's that's a

standard notation so this becomes G Y F

times side dagger left side right plus

side dagger right side left plus Gy

Higgs field times the same thing same

thing okay now we have a prediction for

what the number F where did that kim

will come from the number F we obtained

that same number F went into the mass of

the Z and W bosons the shift of the

Higgs field also determined the mass of

the Z and W bosons once you've measured

the mass of the Z and W bosons and this

was done a long time ago they were

measured the masses are measured about

of order 100 GeV 90 GeV something like

that so that told us what F was that

told us what what the number F was

f is a number of about really 200 GeV

for f okay so that's a number that's a

no it has units of mass incidentally F

has units of mass 200 GeV ah once we

know that from Z and W physics then from

the masses of the fermions we can read

off what these you call couplings are

once we know for example the electron

you tower coupling is some very very

small number why because the electron is

much lighter than the Z and W the you

call coupling for the top quark that's

large why because the top quark is so

heavy so the masses of the quarks wind

up being is you call a couplings times F

and so far we've really gotten out no

more than we put in we've gotten out no

more than we put in we got F from the

Masters of the well a little bit more

but basically mess the masses of ZW

system we got F and then from the

Masters of the fermions

we got the you call couplings alright so

if that's all there was we would have

put in as much as we got out but now we

also have something else we have gy

higgs x things like let's just call them

side agus i these are terms in the

lagrangian which take a fermi on this

incident this could be an electron it

could be a whatever it happens to be

which take a fermi on absorb it and

re-emit it plus a Higgs boson so these

are then processes where let's say

electron or it could be muon or it could

be tau or it could be some quark

emits a Higgs boson or it could be a

Higgs boson coming along and decaying

into an electron and a positron same

diagram

so once the Higgs boson materializes as

a particle in the laboratory we should

know what the various decay decay rates

are for it to decay to the different

kinds of electron positron electron muon

anti muon or whatever well know all of

the interactions between the higgs boson

and the fermions and be able to predict

all the decay rates or the Higgs boson

decay rates obviously it will prefer to

decay to heavier particles as long as

it's enough energy because these you

color couplings are larger your color

couplings of a coupling constant for the

Higgs to break up into its constituents

it into its decay products so at the

moment I mean Higgs ology is a is a pure

theory in the sense that it's predicted

by the theory there seems to be no other

way to make it mathematically consistent

but neither the Higgs nor the direct

couplings to these particles and so

forth have been detected that will

happen well I hope it will happen and so

there's a lot of predictive power theory

also already has an enormous amount of

predictive power predictive power in the

interactions of the Z's and the WS which

are experimentally detected the

interaction of Z's and the W is not only

with respect to the fermions but with

respect to each other

Z's how would you actually create

decay time not only go through all the

nitty-gritty details but I mean sort of

how how would you set it up to actually

make that prediction Wow can you

calculate finding value when you

calculate a Fineman diagram you can just

think of it as elementary quantum

mechanics this gives you a term in the

Hamiltonian which takes the higgs boson

to a pair of particles and it just gives

you the transition amplitude which you

square and once you squared it you

integrate it or summat over all the

final states as an integral to do and

that gives you the decay rate it's a

it's a standard calculation that is

basically a final diagram if you like

this gives you the amplitude you square

the amplitude to get the decay rate

squaring the amplitude you can just do

by putting this right on top of itself

like that here the amplitude is squared

and that becomes a Fineman diagram you

calculate the Fineman diagram by finding

the rules and one of the things that

comes out of it is the decay rate so but

this is more than we're going to do here

that's what we have to do so it's it's a

very very definite calculation within

standard quantum field theory and it's

the kind of calculation we've been doing

since the 1930s so it's quite well known

the only things that you have to put in

which are new are the values of these

coupling constants masses of particles

and so forth okay so that was the masses

of fermions the masses of the Z and W

bosons all of them being proportional to

this constant F why don't we talk about

the the Higgs itself let's

the dynamics of the Higgs boson the

dynamics is really all contained in this

Mexican Hat potential the minimum of the

Mexican Hat potential tells you how much

the field is shifted and it tells you

what F is all right you can make up

different potentials that have this

shape there's a favorite one which

actually has some some important

theoretical significance and it goes as

follows let's go to the origin over here

at the origin the Higgs potential is a

sort of upside down parabola let's

forget what it does far from the origin

let's just concentrate on near the

origin an upside down parabola means

something like - let's call it mu

squared Phi squared and it's traditional

to put a 2 in here it's just traditional

- because it's an upside-down parabola

remember if it was plus mu squared F

square Phi squared what would you call

this term you would call this term the

mass of the Higgs boson you would call

Mew the mass of the Higgs boson or you

would really call Mew squared the square

of the mass of the Higgs boson making it

negative is a little bit weird it's as

if there was an imaginary mass for the

Higgs boson but don't worry there's

nothing wrong with this so it's

perfectly OK to have a potential which

is upside down the only thing which is

unusual about it is putting the field at

the origin is not a stable position it

tends to roll off and roll down the hill

whereas if the mass term was positive it

would oscillate about the top about the

central position here so the field does

not oscillate about the top because of

this minus

by script now if all you have was minus

five squared it would just go down and

down and down and the field would just

run away to infinity there would be no

ground state to the system there would

be no vacuum there were vacuum is the

state of lowest energy there would be no

state of lowest energy so we've got to

put in something to keep it from running

away to infinity we better put in

something to turn it up simplest thing

to turn it up is plus lambda where

lambda is just a number

pure number times five to the fourth

why do I want to put in five why not the

Phi cube the Phi to the Phi to the fifth

why not odd powers because we want to

keep it symmetric on both sides this was

an important aspect of this potential

was to keep it nice and symmetric all

right so five to the fourth is symmetric

if I - but is not this is the next thing

you can put in you can put in all sorts

of things to higher powers here they're

not so important they're not so

important the most important one is Phi

to the fourth and expanding the

potential and a power series you can put

in more but this is the most important

thing and in fact it's also traditional

to put a fall over here you'll see why

in a moment

a - over here and a four over here I

what is this number this number is

called a quartic coupling constant

quartic because it has five to the

fourth it has it is dimensionless it's a

pure number we think we know something

about that pure number not from direct

experimental evidence but from a lot of

indirect evidence and what we know about

that number from somewhat indirect

properties of weak interactions is that

it's small but not absurdly small

probably about one percent probably

about

1.01 or something like that compared to

the numbers we're going to be thinking

about later this is a number which is of

order of magnitude one it's not ten to

the minus twenty it's not ten to the

minus 15 or anything like that so just

think of it as a number for the moment

of order one it's also dimensionless mu

is not dimensional dimensionless it has

units of a mass okay now let's try to

find out what F is f is the position of

the minimum here all we have to do is

minimize this with respect to Phi we've

cooked it up so that it would have a

minimum a rapidly following quadratic

term and then taken over by incidentally

near the origin this is smaller than

this right five to the fourth is smaller

than 5 squared near the origin so this

has not got much effect near the origin

it picks up steam and eventually becomes

much bigger than 5 squared when you go

to large Phi so that turns it back up

that's the logic okay let's just find

the minimum of Phi sorry the minimum of

V with respect to Phi and that will tell

us how much the field gets shifted all

right that's easy we just differentiate

with respect to Phi the derivative of

Phi squared is 2 Phi that eats up this

two down here that's why I put the 2

down there minus mu squared Phi this is

the derivative of V with respect to Phi

plus lambda which is a number of order

of magnitude 1 5 cubed I also put the 4

down here so it would kill the 4 when I

differentiate it with respect to Phi to

the fourth and we set that equal to zero

all right now we can divide by Phi we

divide by Phi make this five squared and

what do we get we get five squared is

equal to MU squared over lambda again

lambda is an ordinary number don't think

of it as very big or very small this is

the value of Phi at the minimum it's

also called F that's also the shift of

the field F and so f squared becomes mu

squared over lambda again I emphasize

lambda is not the interesting number

here it's a common garden-variety number

like like a 1 or a tenth or a hundredth

or something like that it's not very big

that's for sure ok F is controlled by mu

f is also approximately the mass of the

Z in the balsa of the Z in the W boson

it's also the thing which comes into the

mass of the fermions where are they all

of the particles have mass is

proportional to F let's take the square

root of this so it's mu or F or mu which

is the controlling factor which controls

all of these masses all of them all the

masses of what all the particles that we

know about okay that raises an

interesting question why are all of the

particles that we know about controlled

by the same phenomenon namely F why

aren't there particles which have masses

without spontaneous symmetry breaking we

can certainly make up a theory of such

particles for example just make up a

particle who is left-handed and

right-handed

phonons both have weak charge then we

have no reason to put this fire in there

we wouldn't put the fire in there and

you could put any mass that you like in

front of it and it's perfectly symmetric

so if there was a particle ah which was

whose left and right-handed the

components both interacted with the weak

interactions the same way they could

have a mass which was not proportional

to F all kinds of other particles could

all particles that don't have any weak

interactions at all if there was such

particles could have could have masses

which are not controlled by F the

general thinking which we'll come to

which we'll come to and I'll explain why

this is the general thinking is that the

natural mass scale for particle physics

is enormous much much higher than the

masses of any of the ordinary elementary

particles it's thought that only this

one number F is the unusual number in

physics the very very small mass scale

whose origins are at present unknown but

what is thought then though I'll explain

as we well this is this quarter next

quarter various sort of points the idea

that really the only mass / the only

mass parameter the only small mass

parameter in nature is this F here and

those particles which by necessity have

to have masses proportional to F why

because it's in the nature of their

mathematics that they would have to be

massless if there was no shift of F only

those particles are light enough to have

been detected at present that's the

belief that's a very widespread belief

that that there's a good reason why all

the particles have mass is proportional

to F because any that don't probably

have masses which are much much larger

but still we have to explain the

smallness of F small

compared to what well that's an

interesting question small compared with

what what is the natural mass scale for

elementary particle physics so that's

where I think we want to go next hmm

that's one possible mass yes yes all

right

let's see I think it will pick a break

in two minutes but um yes

one possible mess which we'll talk about

in a few minutes after the break is the

Planck mass another is a so-called

unification mass which I'll show you

what it is these masses are typically

sixteen or seventeen orders of magnitude

well let me see um

fifteen orders of magnitude heavier than

the mass than the F 15 orders of

magnitude heavier than the co W boson

for example so what we're left with then

is a puzzle why is this F quantity so

small once we can understand why the F

quantity is so small it drags down the

masses of all the other particles it

drags them down simply because they

cannot have mass were other than

proportional to F they would naturally

be massless in a world without

spontaneous symmetry breaking so yeah

yeah the Metro all right f is a number

of about a hundred GeV

all right that sounds like a lot of it

sounds like a big mass all right the

other mass scales which come into

particle physics which we know about the

other possibly much more fundamental

mass scales are much much heavier than

that fifteen orders of magnitude heavier

than that none that we've ever

discovered obviously right yeah well yes

of course the particles are predicted

but why did we predict them fifteen

orders of magnitude higher in other

words when when I say that there are

other math scales that we know about we

know about them from something so the

question is where do we know about them

if we've never seen if we've never seen

them if we've never seen particles of

those masses we'll talk about that the

after the break

a very very low temperature dense matter

as a things there's also similar laws to

particle physics but aside from that is

there any common in solid state physics

for any common example the case

lightning yes yes all right so you asked

about buzzer condensates so a bose a

condensation or more precisely

superfluidity

which is similar to a bose a

condensation

it's a condensation of helium atoms okay

helium atoms helium atoms of course not

elementary particles okay but on some

scale they are elementary particles so

if you're interested in them in scales

of what a molecular size a helium

nucleus is an elementary particle and it

can be described by a field okay

that field naturally an ordinary vacuum

has a value 0 just corresponding to no

helium atoms present ok spontaneous

symmetry can breaking can happen which

can shift the value of the of the helium

field when that happens in the same way

that that F is a shift of the of the

Higgs field when that happens it's

roughly speaking called

a Bose a condensation when the bose of

condensation happens it spontaneously

breaks a certain symmetry and it's

called

and it creates super fluidity but if the

helium atom were charged if the healing

not the helium nucleus the helium atom

if the helium atom were charged it would

behave like the Higgs boson and make a

mass for the photon now does that ever

happen anything like it ever happened

yes it does in a superconductor

electrons can pair up and bind together

in the superconductor very weakly bound

pairs and those pairs of electrons have

charged to they're not helium atoms

they're not neutral here in the atoms

that call cooper pairs and they're bound

configurations of electron that electron

and positron

electronic noise pairs on a story

separate they're not very far separated

in space that separated the opposite

ends of the Fermi surface right ah no

they think of them as particles first

approximation think of them as particles

they're charged particles and then they

condense they condense which means the

field for this pair of particles gets

shifted you can think of that PA field

is really just being the product of the

electron field with itself describing

two electrons or you can think of it as

a new object which carries charge - when

that field gets shifted it creates a

condensate of Cooper pairs it creates a

kind of super fluidity for the Cooper

pairs but it's now a superfluid of

charged particles it becomes the Higgs

phenomena

it's of course a superconductor and the

superconductor in essentially every

possible way behaves like the Higgs

phenomenon photon gets mass now it's a

tiny tiny mass because the scales are so

terribly different but the the Compton

wavelength of the of the photon becomes

finite and it behaves very very much

like this like this spontaneously

shifted Higgs field in fact the

phenomenon was first discovered in the

context of superconductors and was

rediscovered entirely independently by

by Higgs and other people okay let's

take a little break when you begin at

the primordial description of elementary

particles you begin with Lagrangian and

in the Lagrangian there are a collection

of parameters such as masses of

particles charges of particles and

they're sort of the input on the other

hand they're very rarely if ever the

actual measured quantities the measured

quantities that you actually measure are

usually the product of all kinds of

interactions and things that take place

between the high frequency modes of a

system low frequency modes of the system

which renormalize or change the values

of the parameters that you associate

with experimental observations an

example is electric charge so let's talk

about that a little bit and how charge

gets renormalized not going to do any

calculations calculations you'll have to

go and get a book and then try to follow

it but the phenomena the phenomena is a

fairly simple one that's well known it

occurs in condensed matter physics in

fact it just occurs in classical

electricity and magnetism associated

with electric what's it called

dielectric thank you with the dielectric

materials and conductors the actual

observable charge normally observed the

charge of an object is defined by the

Coulomb law but the Coulomb law at large

separation the asymptotic force between

two charges when they're far apart and

that force as you well know

is the product of the charges let's call

it e 1 e 2 let's take them to be equal

charges and in particular let's suppose

they have charge of the electron just to

be simple then it's just a squared

divided by R squared or in the potential

energy just a square divided by our ID

so you take two charge as far apart and

you measure the charge we measure the

force between them at any given distance

it will not be precisely given by this

formula but if you asymptotically

separate them and you'll find

asymptotically with respect to R the

force between them or the potential

energy between them goes like e squared

over R attractive for opposite charges

repulsive for light charges and that

defines if you like the charge of a

particle Coulomb law at spatially very

large separations now if in a material

you do this you take charges in a

material or even just the air and you

separate them and see what the force law

is you'll find that it's not exactly

given by the formula R in which you go

to the particle physics table the

particle physics table of particle

properties read off the electric charge

of the system typically you won't read

off the electric charge of a ordinary

chunk of material but you might happen

to know how many electrons or how many

uh how many excess protons or electrons

are in it so you might know it's charged

in units of the charge of the electron

you take them apart and you discover

know the force is always a little bit

less than that always a little bit less

than that unless you're an absolute

vacuum an absolute vacuum completely

empty space by definition the electric

charge is what you measure by measuring

the force at a large distance now what

is it that happens in a material let's

begin with a conductor

with an electric conductor what happens

to a charge that's put into the

conductor well the charge creates some

electric field for example suppose it's

a plus charge it creates an outward

electric electric field the electric

field creates a current the current the

the current starts charges moving and

until the charge is completely

discharged until it's completely

discharged in other words until the

current until the charge has gone out to

the boundary of the conductor that's the

flow of charge doesn't stop okay so the

flow of the charge flows until the

charged object let's draw the charged

object over here it is charge flow flows

away from it collect on the boundary but

let's put the boundary off and Alpha

Centauri someplace and of course an

opposite charge so if this is plus an

opposite charge cloud is found around it

it completely discharges it so that

outside there's no electric field at all

and no more reason for the charges to

flow now these charges are of course

bound to the to the charge to the

positive charge the bound to it and the

whole thing forms a neutral structure if

you take another negative charge over

here exactly the opposite thing will

happen to it it will create some plus

charge around it same deal the charges

will flow until it's completely

neutralized and then you take these two

charges you thought you'll had two

charges to begin with you evaluate or

measure the force between them at large

distances and you'll find out that there

is none okay so the charge that you put

in to begin with is not the experimental

charge at the end of the day the

experimental charge at the end of the

day in this case is just plain zero okay

now what happens as you start moving the

two charges let's suppose they're really

small and you start moving them closer

and closer together

this is a screening screen this is a

voting these charges are really small in

particular they're smaller than the

clouds around them to form the clouds

around them are controlled by various

properties of the metal and so forth

and the electrons moving in the metal

and we imagine making these charges even

smaller we bring them really close

together we bring them so close together

that the screening cloud that can't get

between them typically there's a scale

for the screening cloud it's controlled

by the dynamics of the electrons in the

in the system and the screening cloud

the particles making up the screening

cloud typically have a certain distance

between them and that distance controls

the size of the screening cloud when you

bring these two particles closer than

the screening cloud they no longer

screened they actually feel each other's

raw basic charge and you see that

there's a Coulomb force between them

which is the usual isse qer over R so

you could say then that the charge of

the electron or the charge of the

particle in this case is really a

function of distance in the case of the

conductor e of R is zero at very large R

it's whatever the ordinary charge of the

particle is a very small R and the force

law instead of being just plain a

squared over R has a squared of R

divided by R this is just a definition

of e squared of R if you like I don't

put anything new into it by calling it e

squared of our but it does does have a

nice sound to it it's called the running

charge running as a function of distance

between them okay now what happens if

you have something less extreme than a

than a conductor for example a

dielectric dielectric if you like has

electrons which are bound to the atoms

electrons are bound to the atoms but

they're free to shift a little bit if

you like you can almost think of the

electrons as being on Springs where the

one end of the spring the electron is

attached to the other end of the spring

the the ion the positively charged ion

is attached and ordinarily the electron

moves symmetrically vibrates

symmetrically of course this is not

really a good picture of an atom but

it's good enough for our purposes the

electron oscillates and vibrates back

and forth symmetrically about the the

atom so on the average the dipole moment

of the atom is zero but now you put the

atom into an electric field and what

happens is the electron cloud shifts a

little bit and it shifts a little bit

leaving a dipole leftover ah

the current doesn't flow charge just

shifts a little bit because they're

bound to the three atoms okay so now

what happens if you put a charge into a

dielectric well a very similar

phenomenon happens let's suppose we put

a minus charge in over here all the ions

are there heavy they don't move very

much but the electrons which are bound

to them by the springs move out away

from the from the central atom what does

that leave that leaves a little bit of

plus charge here but it doesn't

completely screen the charge it screens

some fraction of the charge so that if

you look very very far away from the

charged particle you'll find that the

field the electric field is diminished

by a certain fraction but it doesn't go

to zero very far away okay the fraction

is controlled by the dielectric constant

dielectric constant will tell you how

what the what the screening is so again

you'll find that a large separation is

plus

- charge don't satisfy the expected

Coulomb law that you might have expected

from the actual let's call it the bear

charge of these particles but it's

diminished by this by this effect it's

diminished the Coulomb law is correct

but with a diminished value of the

charge so in this case you would also

have an e squared of R on e of R again

if you bring the charges very close

together so that they're within the

screening cloud then you feel the full

strength of a bear charge so again R

squared is a function of R in this case

it wouldn't go to zero and infinity it

would just go to some constant fraction

of the original charge again the concept

of a running charge all right now

exactly this phenomenon it really is

exactly this phenomenon happens in

quantum field theory and the origin of

it is the pairs let's state quantum

electrodynamics in quantum

electrodynamics the vacuum is full of

electron positron pairs okay there are

finding diagrams where electrons

positrons are created by photons even

just even just electron positron loops

with nowhere with no photons and they

inhabit the vacuum if you like the other

way you can think about it is you can

think about it in terms of Dirac's

negative energy see the vacuum is filled

with this negative energy C or you can

imagine that there are electron positron

pairs of the vacuum what happens when an

electric field comes along the electric

field will shift the positrons one way

and shift the electrons the other way so

that every little virtual pair

electron-positron pair will become

polarized polarized in exactly the same

way that atoms become polarized by an

electric field the plus charge is

shifting one way the minus charge is

shifting the other way that's what

happens in the vacuum when you put an

electric field on ah okay that's that's

step number one step number two of

course you put in what you thought

was an original bear charge of magnitude

II the charges in the vacuum rearranged

a little bit the vacuum is basically a

dielectric it's basically a dielectric

the charge is shift a little bit and in

such a way that negative charges are

screened by a little bit of positive

charge from these virtual pairs and

positive charges are screened by a

little bit of negative charge the upshot

is the charge that's felt at a large

distance is not the same as the

numerical value of the charge that you

put into the Lagrangian which is usually

called the bare electric charge but

again you start moving the electrons

closer and closer to each other and at

some point they get closer than the size

of the screening cloud but there's one

difference in this case in this case

there's the there is no set distance

that the electron positrons tend to be

from a be separated by the right

statement is that the separation between

the electron positron pairs depends on

their energy are the higher the energy

of the virtual pair the closer they will

be so there will be electron positron

pairs which form relatively big let's

call them atoms they're not atoms but

let's call them atomic neutral systems

there will be ones of higher virtual

energy which are smaller ones of yet

higher virtual energy which are even

smaller ones which are higher energy

which are even smaller okay so what

happens when you put the charging arm

and and bring another charge closer and

closer and closer at first you will

bring them close enough that they'll be

within the distance of the low energy

virtual pairs the low energy virtual

pairs will no longer be able to screen

the charge and so the charge will

a little bit smaller sorry a little bit

bigger than it would when they were far

apart why when they were far apart they

were completely screened not completely

screened but they were screened by all

possible virtual pairs you bring a

little bit closer the low-energy virtual

pairs which had a large separation

between them you bring the charges

closer than that and the low-energy

virtual pairs are no longer important

and screening but the higher energy

virtual pairs are still doing some

screening you bring them a little closer

the higher energy pairs fall out of the

equation because they're too far apart

and yet higher energy ones are still

there the effect is that that East

squared of R is a function which keeps

changing and changing and changing with

R ah it doesn't stop changing at some

small and some particular small distance

the closer and closer you bring the

electron together the larger the charge

will appear to be so if you were to plot

B by virtue of the fact that there are

pairs of every possible energy in the

vacuum so if you were to plot the

electric charge as a function of radial

separation let's plot it as a function

of inverse radial separation inverse

radial separation is like energy

closer things are together the higher

their energy so let's plot it as a

function of inverse separation 1 over R

which is also related to energy or

momentum or whatever then the electric

charge that you'll see will increase

it'll increase very slowly in fact it's

a very slow logarithmic increase it

doesn't increase rapidly that's why it's

very hard to see in an experiment it's a

logarithmic gradual increase of the sign

of the size of an electric charge as you

study smaller and smaller

distance phenomenon it's also true for

example electric charge comes into

calculations of scattering of electrons

if you scatter electrons at a low energy

they only get within a certain distance

of each other the higher the energy is

scatter them thus closer those electrons

can get to each other by virtue of the

uncertainty principle and when you do

the calculation you'll have to put in

the running charge if you count if you

scatter electrons at enormous ly high

energy they behave as if they had a

larger charge then at the smaller

distances so that brings us to the idea

of running charge what is the

fundamental charge what is the most

fundamental value of the charges at the

1 of long distances no that's the one

that's controlled by all of this

complicated screening taking place as

you get as you get to smaller and

smaller distances you sort of peel away

the screening cloud as you get the

smaller and smaller distances you peel

away more and more of the screening

cloud so it's really at the smallest

distances where the basic parameter that

you put into the Lagrangian the Bay of

charge manifest itself yeah well you

start seeing a measurable effect but a

high-precision measurable effect at a

few times a day at about the Compton

wavelength of the electron so what's

that 10 to the minus 11 center of

Compton wavelength of the electron the

electron is half an MeV so that's about

10 to the minus 11 centimeters at 10 to

the minus 11 centimeters you start to

see you start to see the running of the

charge we're not alone

listen well it would keep going on if

the physics didn't change somehow of

very small distances we don't know what

the physics is a very very small I think

this says that I vote sort of like this

fall wonders there there we don't know

what happened and very small right

that's that's right that's right we

don't know what happens is very small so

we can only extrapolate a certain yeah

so for the ones is gonna be awesome

thing if there's some nd we gosh it does

well then that's a more complicated

phenomenon more complicated phenomena

that's closely connected with the fact

that gluons interact with gluons and

because gluons interact with gluons in a

very nonlinear kind of way the effect is

actually the opposite all right this is

you go to infinitely small distances and

you measure an infinitely small distance

is the interaction and that's the bare

electric charge but you'll never get

them in fairly small distances because

no it doesn't asymptotically it just

keeps growing and growing and growing

right right so it keeps growing until

something happens that was not taken

into account by these calculations what

could it be

our smallest distance in the world the

Planck distance something else happens

and from experimental physics we don't

know what terminates this we certainly

believe it's terminated at the Planck

length this physics certainly doesn't

make sense

we say that's fair electric charge so

but you see you can compensate you can

change that length and if you also at

the same time change what you called a

bear charge it would compensate right so

at any given level you could terminate

it call that charge the bear charge at

that length or change the length scale

if you appropriately and judiciously

change the value of the bear charge when

it comes out at the low energy end won't

won't all about it all right so that's

the phenomenon of renormalization

changing things in such a way is to keep

the physics the experimental known

physics - you're suing in change

zooming in and looking at closer and

closer distances now of course we don't

do that experimentally so we do that in

our mind and we ask how do we have to

change the physics and smaller and

smaller distances to keep it fixed at

experimentally accessible distances how

do we have to change the electric charge

as we go to smaller and smaller

distances in order to keep the physics

fixed at any given wavelength so what

this is telling us is that as we go to

smaller and smaller more and more

refined description more and more

fine-grained description the value of

the electric charge that we have to put

into the into the bare description has

to grow now as I said that will change

at some point where the physics that

quantum electrodynamics gives way to

something else okay so that's the

electric challenge

yeah if that's the same phenomena happy

with gravity in equations or somewhat

similar we'll talk it's quite a

different phenomenon but the will we'll

come to it

perhaps today I don't know we'll come to

it today maybe okay now let's talk about

the strong interactions the strong

interactions things are more complicated

let me remind you of what we learned

about the force law between quarks the

force law between quarks does not behave

like a squared over R what happens is

some new phenomena where the flux lines

that come out of quarks these are not

the electromagnetic flux lines these are

the flux lines of QCD that called chromo

electric flux lines attract each other

they attract each other in a way that

does not happen in electrodynamics it's

the self interaction between gluons

right and that has the effect of turning

the Coulomb field into long tube-like

structures which are sort of squeezed by

the vacuum into these long tube-like

structures the effect of this is as you

separate quarks the energy grows

linearly with the separation between

between them you create this Turkish

taffy gooey stuff in between them and

the energy of it grows simply as the

length of the gooey thing between them

that means that the force law the energy

grows linearly what is the force grab

all right so let's write that down

instead of going instead of the energy

growing like a squared over R it's just

it just grows linearly with r so this is

the wrong formula we should have put

here perhaps Z squared or something like

YZ squared times R let's not call it

something times are well we can either

say we had completely the wrong theory

or we can say that a squared is growing

like r-squared we can say the picture

from electrodynamics the charges are

screened simply the opposite happens

that a squared grows with separation

something happens in this nonlinear

effect here which is quite the opposite

and so a squared grows with separation

incidentally at very small distances

again distances which are so small

smaller than the size of these flux

tubes it reverts back to e squared over

R okay so it reverts back to the good

old Coulomb law but another way of

saying it is that instead of e squared

as a function of distance getting larger

with distance it actually gets smaller

with distance B squared is getting

smaller no sorry

with inverse distance its getting

smaller with inverse distance larger

with distance smaller with inverse

distance so therefore if I plot the

quantum chromodynamics coupling constant

it will fall as a function of inverse R

like that what about the one for the

weak interactions

well the weak interactions are sort of

in between sort of in between ah they

have similarities with both they're in

between so I go like that well maybe not

as fast it's an interesting and quite

remarkable fact that if you actually

take the standard model and you work out

how the charges first of all you need to

know what the various coupling constants

are in the laboratory

those are the ones that control physics

at whatever scales you've done your

experiment

100 GeV or whatever and you put in their

values and then you run them using just

the standard model the polarization of

the vacuum and all the properties from

the standard model these three numbers

more or less come together at a common

point they more or less come together at

a common point now in a more refined

wallet in a in the super symmetric

version of the theory which we will talk

about next time a little bit next

quarter they come together with rather

high precision about 1% about 1% they

come together about 1% that looks like

there's something happening at some

energy which is unifying these forces

they're coupling constants seem to be

the same at some high energy here if you

just extrapolate these curves the curves

are calculable of course you have to

assume that no new physics comes in the

no new physics comes in or if new

physics comes in you have to take it

into account no physics might shift

these curves a little bit in the super

symmetric version of the theory these

three numbers come together very nicely

to about 1% add an energy of about 10 to

the 16th GeV why is that energy so high

it's because these curves very

logarithmically

they very slowly okay when things very

slowly they very slowly and so it takes

a long range of scales before they come

together and they come together at about

10 to the 16th GeV 10 to 14 times larger

than the mass of the W alright so it's

some huge energy it looks from these

curves that some kind of unification is

taking place there now is this good

enough to the

is this it's a relatively high precision

agreement in the supersymmetric theory

in a non supersymmetric theory it's not

such high precision agreement but it's

tantalizing and it's interesting that

the that this is the the tendency for

things alright if this is correct you

might guess that the fundamental length

scale of particle physics of the

standard model is up at this 10 to the

15 GeV

it's where the input seems to be

simplest simplest and that the three

coupling constants seem to be the same

we'll talk about what that means

mathematically it has a very deep map

that could have a very deep mathematical

meaning but for the moment it's just an

observation about numbers that they come

together at a particular energy now that

energy also happens to be the place if

you were to plot the strength of

gravitational forces gravitational

forces are very weak at large distances

but I'm going to show you why in a

moment they get stronger and stronger

and stronger at small distances not only

because of the usual one over R squared

in the force but above and beyond that

the forces of gravitation becomes

stronger and stronger and if you will to

lay on top of that let's say the forces

of gravitation would become strong at

small distances so that would mean

gravitational forces which are

incredibly weak at long distances would

do something like that and they don't

quite all cross at the same place but

they cross within a factor you remember

these are logarithmic curves they cross

within a couple of orders of magnitude

of each other a gravitational the weak

the electromagnetic and the strong

interaction cross all within a couple of

decades of energy of each other or a

couple of decades of length scale at

about somewheres between 10 to the 16 17

to 18

GeV so what all this means

especially the gravitational side of it

we don't know but if there is a

unification scale and if this really

does correspond to some unity between

the three forces it looks like it

happens at a scale which is not too

different than the Planck scale the

Planck scale is the scale where gravity

would become comparable to the other

forces so let's talk a little bit about

gravitational forces and why I say that

gravity gets stronger at small distances

ordinarily now we're going to talk about

what happens the gravitational forces as

you vary the distance scale and the only

point to you is that when you understand

how gravity depends on length scale

you'll find out that gravity sort of

falls on the same ballpark with the

other forces act scales which are very

small that gravity is really no weaker

than in these other forces okay so to

understand this we first have to erase

the blackboard a little bit

we used to thinking that that the force

law of gravity is 1 over R squared or

Coulomb be surprised if I told you it's

really 1 over R cubed at very small

distances you wouldn't be surprised but

you wouldn't ok so let's go through why

it's 1 over R cubed and very small

distances the reason is we write down

what do we write family right force

let's work let's work for force this

time we worked with energy before it

doesn't matter which will work with

force is equal to n m2 particles masses

on R squared and Newton's constant right

that's the force between two particles

all right now this is a non relativistic

formula this is the formula for

particles at rest when particles have a

high energy or when objects have a high

energy its energy that gravitates and

not the not mass not rest mass a moving

object will gravitate more than an

object at rest if you take a box full of

high-energy particles those high-energy

particles will gravitate more than they

would if they were brought to rest

within the box so the right formula or a

more correct formula a more correct

formula is to put here

use e equals MC squared or n mm squared

e equals MC squared

or better yet n equals E over C squared

and put in here energy of particles e e

over C square over C fourth I believe

right over C fourth all right so this is

a formula which is more accurate when

the particles are relativistic okay now

let's go to quantum mechanics and

imagine bringing two particles very

close together much closer together than

their Compton wavelengths because of the

uncertainty principle if we've brought

them close together and we know that

they're close together that means that

the momentum is extremely uncertain to

say that the momentum is extremely

uncertain you can say that the momentum

is very large roughly speaking if you

brought them to within a distance R of

each other the momentum of them must be

at least of order what is it

H bar over R right okay now what about

the energy of these particles the energy

of these particles you might think well

the energy of a particle at rest is MC

squared if it has a little bit of

velocity you add plus one-half MV

squared sorry 1 MV squared over 2 but

what happens when the momentum gets

really large when R gets very small when

all gets very small these particles

become highly relativistic why their

momentum gets much larger than any

pre-assigned number when they get very

very close together what's the energy of

a particle a relativistic particle with

momentum P relativistic means it's

moving with almost the speed of light

anybody remember

was it now lets them know that's

nonrelativistic completely no no no the

energy is P times the speed of light

right P times the speed of light okay so

we can now say P is H bar over R and now

we can plug this into the force between

particles okay so what is it F is equal

to H bar squared let's just the

particles come close together let's

assume they both have this about the

same energy which is a good assumption

so that's H bar squared C squared over R

squared that's just a squared here u1

times e2 that's this factor here then

there's a C to the fourth in the

denominator from here there's a G and

another R squared so R to the fourth did

I get it right right

the sea squares cancel yeah bro don't

cancel c-squared when i said the force

law was one of our cube that meant the

energy not the not the not the force the

force is one over R to the fourth so

when you bring particles really close

together squeeze them by whatever means

either an accelerator accelerates them

to very high energy so they can get very

very close together or you put them in a

box and squeeze well the no box is going

to hold particles that are that

relativistic but somehow or another when

the particles get that close together

the the force law is quite different

than Coulomb it's 1 over R to the fourth

okay

now let's ask the following question

yeah it's an attractive force right and

it is much more potent at small

distances than it is at large distances

1 over R to the fourth is much much

bigger than one of our one of them what

overall this is one of R squared this is

because the relativistic speed up causes

a massive increase but not in charge

increase right right right exactly

exactly so exactly so ok now let's ask

at what length scale R is the

gravitational force approximately the

same order of magnitude as the

electromagnetic force let's do a little

Siletz there's the electric charge the

electrons electric charge is a pure

number it happens to be fairly small

let's forget it but not not ridiculously

small it's a fairly small number of

something like a tenth or something like

that in natural natural units so for

first round we could just set the

electric charge of an electron equal to

one for simplicity and then we could ask

at what length scale is the force the

gravitational force between a pair of

particles the same as the

electromagnetic force let's say a pair

of electrons does that ever happen at

ordinary scales electric forces are

vastly larger than electricity than

gravity gravitational forces electric

forces as you bring them closer together

because the gravitational forces

increase like one over R to the fourth

eventually the gravitational force will

cross the the electrostatic force and

it's smaller distances will become even

more important even larger so let's see

where that happens to find out where

that happens

we should set this equal to e squared

over R squared for simplicity for the

moment let's just set the electric

charge equal to one it's not equal to

one it's about a tenth or something

about that's smaller than once

hmm it G or E oh sorry I didn't mean to

erase dream and I'll do that e let's uh

let's simplify and put a 1 here which is

not too long a squared is really

something like about a tenth okay but

it's not too bad it's proximately right

now we can read off from this at what

scale these two kinds of forces become

equal to each other just multiplied by R

to the fourth

this becomes R squared here

now take the square root of it or did I

uh something wrong

it's our square yeah I think I made a

mistake that's still think I made a

mistake

hmm no but it's not right

wait um yeah

H Bar C over C squared R to the fourth

is 1 over R squared right so I have h

bar G over c h bar G over C is equal to

R it was an R it was an R to the fourth

here right and then there was a 1 over R

squared here so I got an R squared here

right what am I going to get I'm going

to get H bar over C H bar over C square

root of G right all right which is the

square root of H bar squared G over C

squared no C squared set dimensionally

correct must be

no no electric charge is dimensionless

in whoa wait a second wait a second wait

a second yeah hold on I think I think I

lost some dimensions this is energy oh

this is alright let's let's work let's

do it in terms of energy its R cubed in

terms of energy and I want to set that

equal to e squared over R but this is

not dimensionally consistent the

follower is dimensionless so I need some

I need some H bars and C's in there hmm

well I want the charge to be

dimensionless because I happen to know

its value in dimensionless units it's

about 1/10 it's close to 1 so so we have

to put some correct this has units of

energy right if I so so we have 1 over R

1 over R and if I put in this is not

correct yet it's not correct it's not

dimensionally consistent if I put an H

bar here then this would be momentum but

put a see there it is now dimensionally

consistent all right see H bar over R

has units of energy and now this

electric charge here is dimensionless

and that's the one which is which is

about 1/10 close to 1 ok so I've made a

mistake I thought I made a mistake I

should have

oh I erased it it's lost it's gone

I think it's right now

okay now multiply it by our scar cubed

and we get R squared up here now we get

a seed that C cube down here and remove

an H bar and I get R now is equal to the

square root of G H bar over C cubed I

think I like that better all right

what is that length that's the plot

length that's the Planck length so the

Planck length is the place where because

of this growth of energy with squeezing

with with diminishing the wavelength

because of that the gravitational force

increases and becomes comparable or even

bigger

a few factors of 10 bigger than the

electromagnetic force at the Planck

length so they also so the

electromagnetic force the weak force the

strong force and the gravitational force

all grow or all become more or less

comparable somewheres near the Planck

scale this is thought to be deep this is

thought to be something important if it

is as important as it sounds

then the puzzle becomes not why is the

plunk length so small why is the plunk

mass so large or why is that 10 to the

19 such a big number it is why that F is

so small in natural units how does it

happen that that F which controls the

masses and the energy scales of all weak

electromagnetic interactions in

particular controls the mass of the Z

the W the quarks the electron why is it

so small it's one

number R which is now some 15 orders of

magnitude smaller than than any

fundamental length scale as far as we

can tell and it's just that one number

which is very small once that one number

is explained why it is so small all the

masses of all the elementary particles

that we know about follow all the others

for all we know could be up at the

Planck mass at the natural scale they

have no reason to be light they won

their masses did not have to be

proportional to this symmetry breaking

scale so that's that's kind of where we

are puzzled about why this F is so small

now well we'll go more deeply into this

next quarter it's not only that it's

small it's also very very finely tuned

if you somehow calculate F then you can

calculate the other masses if you could

calculate F you agree but you can but

any any ordinary calculation of F will

give a huge number why because it'll

come out to be proportional to the

fundamental scale unless unless there's

some incredible conspiracy that so yeah

you can calculate it also

I'm trying to visualize the plot length

in terms of the screening distance when

we get so congratulation physics my

hopeful Krieger Street just monthly

speakers if you get higher fee I wrote

is one T to the sixth et cetera each 34

people speak 55

well the way there are real reasons why

not you wouldn't want to put in 550

fifth there because that would break the

symmetry between plus Phi and minus Phi

you could put five six there but there

are knowledge creation operators

response you know that that represents

for inspiring astronomy absolutely

okay so that's another right once you

know these numbers you can predict

something about the scattering of Higgs

bosons to Higgs bosons go to to hit

photons right R is the Roger of

polynomial

and all new variables okay so that's

very restricted well it's not it's more

restrictive than you think

beyond fight to the fourth becomes what

is called man renormalizable which is a

bad thing to have in a theory so we can

talk about why 5/4 is the natural result

of this the Raj is all known on all

three values and there's never any

exponent before right except when there

is any any term

well self interactions or what goes into

the running of these coupling constants

for example the self interactions

between gluons are what gave you the

opposite effect from what happens in

electrodynamics self interaction between

flux lines pulls them together into a

into a sort of cable and the upshot is

that the running electric charge

any other thing I thought it was well

there are such things they come in in

higher orders and you have to calculate

them but fortunately for us all of the

coupling constants are quite small so

the higher order cross terms are smaller

than what exactly which means it is fine

to I

I guess it's important since we talked

about revitalization groups can you say

something not tonight but some part for

more please visit us at stanford.edu
