alright let's get back to su 3 and su 2

su 3 was QCD and it's the symmetry which

what did we say it acted vertically on

our table

it took us from one color red green and

blue and mix them up let's just let's

just remind ourselves about that so we

made ourselves a table this is a table

not of all elementary particles

obviously but it's table of all the

fermions yeah it's a table of all of the

fermions in the standard model and not

so much because they're fermions but

just happens that they're kind of the

constituents that's constituent

particles of the atom in the nucleus

all right so let's just write them down

again there were the six different

families of quarks the families refer to

well I'll tell you what they refer to

there's the up and down that's called a

family that's called the up/down family

then there is let's up down charm

strange I guess you can call it a charm

with a strange family and then there's

the top and the bottom

that's the horizontal structure and then

we have red green and blue and we have a

cork in each one of these slots let's

take this bar away here take this bar

away and take this one over here away we

have a cork in each one of these slots

and the color symmetry the su3 symmetry

color which is associated with quantum

chromodynamics is the symmetry group

which acts on this triplet here and

mixes them up into each other that

symmetry group has generators those

generators correspond to the infinitely

small transformations but it also

corresponds to the gluons the symmetry

group which takes red to green to blue

is associated with the existence of

gluons and the gluons when they're

emitted from one quark to another for

example from red to green you create a

red sorry red-green bar glue on this

transformation from red to green is

simply one of the generators of SU 3 so

the generators of SU 3 the

transformations are in one-to-one

correspondence with the emission of Ag

lawn you can think of an emission of a

glue on as a physical act which are

physical phenomenon which does the same

thing as the symmetry group which mixes

the particles into each other that's the

character of gauge bosons gauge bosons

are a sort of manifestation of the

symmetry group in which the emission of

a gauge boson really does change a a

particle from one

to another in exactly the same pattern

as the symmetry group would change one

thing to another all right so that's red

green and blue and when you perform one

of these transformations you do it on

all of the quarks simultaneously you

don't do it just in the up quarks or

just the up/down family if you want the

symmetry to be correct if you want it to

be a real symmetry of the theory then

you must do it simultaneously on all of

the quarks and that corresponds to the

statement that exactly the same glue on

ah let's say this is from up to up up

quark to up quark incidentally the glue

on emission does not change horizontally

it only changes vertically so for

example the same glue on which would be

involved in emitting or which would be

emitted when a red up quark becomes a

green up quark that's exactly the same

glue on as would be emitted when let's

say when a a top red quark would be a

top green quark red-green bar luan so

symmetry takes whole rows and mixes them

into each other then there was a second

symmetry by now it's actually a third

symmetry we've talked about

electrodynamics and what it does to the

what the emission of a photon or what

the what the symmetry associated with

electrodynamics is but now we're

encountering another symmetry which is

usually called flavor symmetry flavor

symmetry or I guess the family symmetry

somehow sometimes it takes ups to downs

at the same time that it takes charm to

strange at the same time

takes top to bottom bottom keeping the

color unchanged so for example there

will be processes in which an up quark

let's say of the blue variety emits a w+

boson which w+ and it becomes a down

quark also of the blue variety so what

has this W boson done it's a physical

manifestation of the transformation

which takes you horizontally back and

forth exactly the same w+ would mediate

or would be emitted the same kind of w+

would be emitted when a are green let's

say charm quark becomes a green strange

quark same w+ and so forth the gluons

never move your horizontally the W

bosons never move you vertically and

that is also the character of the

symmetry groups the symmetry groups move

your horizontally

that's su - it doesn't move you from

here to here or from here to here it

just moves you between up and down down

and up or at the same time charm and

strange strength to charm and so forth

that's the mathematical structure of SU

3 cross su 2 if you add the photon the

photon emission is associated with the

symmetry which changes the phase of

every charge carrying field which I

explained that to you last time every

charge carrying field transforms with a

phase under u1

and if you add those three together you

have the basic ingredients of su 3 cross

su 2 cross u 1 cross simply means that

it's a product structure where the su

twos don't mix up the colors and the su

threes don't mix up the upness and down

this one's a product structure and

that's where the terminology that's

where the I guess you call it

terminology that the standard model is a

gauge theory based on the gauge group su

3 cross su 2 cross u 1 now it is

actually a little bit more complicated

than I'm saying we're going to sort out

the complications but roughly speaking

su-34 color su 2 for the W emission and

u14 electrodynamics now this is good

it's going to get slightly more

complicated than that

because what I'm saying is not a hundred

percent consistent for reasons that will

become clear but not yet all right the

emission of a W boson incidentally of

course W bosons are only discovered

relatively late in the game and they

were postulated sometime in the 60s but

but it really only achieved some real

traction in 70s the W bosons but the

theory of weak interactions or some

aspects of the theory of weak

interactions goes back much earlier than

that I supposed to the 30s the family

theory of weak interactions and we'll

discuss the relationship soon enough

okay what about the coupling constants

that are involved in these various

interactions the u 1 coupling constant

here that's associated

the emission of a photon and the

coupling constant is simply the electric

charge the reason that the emission or

the reason that the probability of the

emission of a photon is the

fine-structure constant is because this

is the amplitude for the emission of a

photon you have to square it to find the

probability for the for the photon to be

present so e squared is basically the

fine-structure constant it has some PI's

and things that's not important but but

e squared is basically the

fine-structure constant and it's also

the coupling constant or the emission

the quantum mechanical amplitude for the

emission of a photon either the virtual

emission of a photon which means that

the photon is going to be reabsorbed

before it gets very far or if the

electron is jerked out of the way then

the real emission of a photon the

amplitude for that is this constant

called the electric charge and it's a

pure number and it's a number

well the fine-structure constant itself

the square of this number is as I told

you about 1 over 137 okay so it's a

small number or here the SU 3 coupling

constant that's usually called G or we

can call it G strong G sub s that of

course is associated with the emission

of a gluon and that's also a number that

number is close to warning well not

clear if that's a little one is a little

bit too big are the corresponding thing

corresponding to the fine-structure

constant would be more like about 1/5

1/5 is a lot bigger than a 1 over 137 so

the emission of a gluon is a much much

more probable event when a good when a

quark smacks into something

it basically emits a gluon with a

probability close to one almost always

emits a glue one whereas the photon

almost never emits a photon now you

might think in view of the fact that the

weak interactions are called very

weakened there are cold weak

interactions and in fact from the fact

that the decay rates are very much lower

associated with weak interactions the

weak interactions are indeed in many

many ways very much weaker than either

the glue onic interaction or the

electromagnetic interaction but it's not

because the coupling constant is smaller

the coupling constant of the weak

interactions is closely related to the

coupling constant for quantum

electrodynamics it's about the same

order of magnitude are related it's

related by some some simple numerical

factor but not the not very different so

that raises the question what is it

about these processes involving W bosons

that makes it so improbable so unlikely

that a weak interaction will take place

and it is unlikely after all it takes

the Neutron 12 minutes to decay it must

be a very unlikely process so that's the

next question let's think about the

decay of the neutron okay of the neutron

originates from a Down quark inside the

neutron down quark emitting a w- and

becoming an up quark so let's add in the

other quarks there's another down quark

and an up quark alright this is a

neutral oh sorry this is a neutron and

up and two downs and this is a proton -

ups and down and the W goes off that's W

- but then the W can also become W - can

become an electron and an anti-neutrino

ah let's go let's go back to this table

here let me remind you there are more

particles more fermions the additional

fermions are the leptons the leptons

come in basically the same pattern up

their charm strange top bottom but they

do not carry color the meaning of that

is they don't participate at all in the

color interactions now your first were

perfectly free to ask me why and I'm

perfectly free to say I don't know so

however there's a pattern and the

pattern is not it does have some

structure to it but I'll tell you what

not tonight but at some point maybe we

will understand this pattern better

almost as though it were a fourth color

are the leptons now the leptons do not

have the same charges as the quarks let

me just remind you these this column

would be the quarks with charge 2/3 and

this column would be the quarks we

charge minus 1/3 and notice that this

one has one more unit of charge than

this one the difference of charge is one

unit all right down in this lepton car

row over here the different the same is

true over here of course 2/3 minus 1/3

2/3 minus 1/3 now the emission of a

double you only cares about the

difference of charge

in other words allowed W can be emitted

if the difference of charge is the right

thing all right W plus or the W minus

has a definite charge

and to admit it the difference of charge

of the initial and final Fermi on must

be correct alright so if the W can be

emitted when a neutrino becomes an

electron or when it becomes an electron

becomes a neutrino the charge difference

must be the same okay

in fact what goes down here would be the

new to the neutrino the electron

neutrino and the electron the charge

difference is the same this has charge

minus one this has charge zero so the

charge difference is the same and it is

mathematically consistent to say that a

W boson the same W boson can be emitted

when a neutrino becomes an electron ah

in the next column under the charge

under the charm strange column comes the

anti the sorry the neutrino associated

with the muon and the muon

the muon is in every respect at least as

far as we know essentially the same as

the electron except its mass is about

200 times larger again no rhyme no

reason for that at the present time and

then under the top bottom column the

heaviest of the quarks is matched with

the heaviest of the electrons we

incidentally we don't know the details

of the masses of the neutrinos very well

all right this neutrino associated with

a towel lepton and the Tau lepton and

the Tau lepton is quite a bit heavier

than any other lepton lepton I

understand it was I I don't remember

right now what the word lepa Greek

stands for what is it light

not heavy right oh and baryons stand for

heavy you know and meson stand for

something in there that's right Meza

okay the terminology historically was a

little bit confused mesons meant

something in the middle baryons meant

something heavy like protons and

neutrons and leptons meant something

light well because of that the muon was

called the MU meson because it was sort

of midway between the proton and the

electron that terminology went away when

it was realized just how different the

muon was from the PI on which has a

comparable mass to it it was much more

like the electron than it was like the

PI on and so mez arms are now reserved

for quark antiquark pairs and they're

always bosons and muon is no longer ever

called the MU meson so that's just a

historical note okay now what does what

is the probability of this process it

has it's a Fineman diagram every Fineman

diagram has some parts to it and the

parts consist first of all of vertices

and propagators propagators are the

elements which have to do with the

motion of a particle from one point to

another in this particular case the

motion of the w from the point where

it's emitted to the point where the

electron neutrino or electron

antineutrino are created all right so

this process has two main ingredients

that we can isolate from the rest of it

one of them is two powers let's give the

coupling constant the name the coupling

constant for the emission of a w let's

call it G W G either for W boson or for

weak the QCD

the strong interaction coupling constant

for emitting a a gluon we called G

strong this one is G weak as I said it's

a number about the same

order magnitude as the electron charge

so it's not enormous Li small it's not

this it's not the smallness of this

coupling constant which accounts for the

improbable nature of weak interactions

all right so first of all we get two

powers G weak squared that's analogous

to the two powers of electron charge if

we extreme if we exchange a photon this

is expected to be a number of about 1

over 100 it's not exactly the

fine-structure constant it's within a

factor of 3 or something it's close to

the fine-structure constant order

magnitude that's what this is but then

there's something else there is the

propagator of the W boson so we have to

know a little bit about propagators in

quantum field theory they are the

factors which are inserted into a

Fineman diagram to account for the

motion of a particle from one point to

another all right as such they are

simply functions of the space-time

difference of the space-time distance

between the emission and absorption

their functions if you like of the

magnitude or the proper time along

between this event in that event but in

any case they're functions that

propagator let's call it Delta Delta for

a distance between the two points it's a

function of the space-time different

distance between those points function

of distance and it has the following

property it depends crucially on the

mass of the particle that's being

exchanged it depends on the following

way if we what if we were to plot it if

we were to plot it as a function of

distance

now if we went through all the

mathematics of quantum field theory and

worked out the propagator we would find

that it's got a lot of stuff in it it's

got Bessel functions it's a kind of

complicated function but not that

complicated but the important aspect of

it is that it is large at small

distances and falls or grows like one

over the distance to some power went

over the distance squared between the

two points so it's very large at small

distances but then at and if the

particle had no mass it would just

continue on its way with the same power

law fall-off it would just fall off

gradually with one universal behavior

which would go like one over the square

of the distance between the points

that's the way it would be behaved but

the mass of this particle introduces a

new ingredient it introduced as an

ingredient which causes the propagator

to decrease suddenly like that it

decreases exponentially fast

exponentially fast in other words the

power law gives rise to an exponential

and the interesting question is where

does that happen where does that happen

at what value of distance does the mass

suddenly manifest itself and tell a

particle hey you're out there and you

shouldn't be out there because you're

carrying off mass and there's no mass to

carry off I mean you're carrying off

some mass from a UH from there just is

none you've got to get back there that's

but the you know if I think about in

terms of the story the propagator has an

exponential decrease where does it

happen and the answer is just

dimensional analysis in units in which C

equals H bar equals one pick such units

mass mass has the same sorry mass has

the same units now when I write M equals

I simply mean units what's the usual

notation for units to put a square

bracket around the quantity okay

standard notation for the units of an

object that to put a bracket around it a

mass has the same units as an energy

well why is that that's because he

equals MC squared let's see is equal to

1 etc etc but they also have the same

units as inverse length length mass has

the same units as inverse length or or

incidentally is there there's a third

quantity which has the same units of

mass and energy what is it momentum same

as momentum now what about momentum

times distance what are the units of

momentum times distance no uncertainty

uncertainty principle think uncertainty

principle momentum times distance is H

bar but H bar is dimensionless in these

units so momentum and distance simply

have inverse units to each other okay

so therefore length has inverse distance

to both mass energy and also momentum

and therefore we can say that we can

write it differently we can write that

length has units of inverse mass yeah 1

over mass

well that tells us the horizontal axis

here was distance D the mass of the

particle is in and that tells us that

the distance at which it falls off like

this the only way that we can make a

distance using the mass of a particle

occurs at a distance of one over the

mass of the particle now that's really

the the Compton wavelength of the

particle if we put back some C's and H

bars what would it be H bar of MC let's

put back the H bars and H bar over MC

distance of a at a distance of order H

bar over MC the propagator suddenly

dives down and as an exponential the

vertical axis is the size of Delta Delta

and what it is is it's square of the

propagator is the probability that a

particle can go that far before it

before it emits so what this is saying

is that there's a sudden sharp turn off

of the probability for the particle to

go a given distance before converting

like this which is controlled by the

mass of a particle in particular the

heavy of the mass of the particle the

less the distance it can go before it

has to give up its energy in this form

all right now um usually what's

prescribed in an experiment is not the

two points where these events take place

what's prescribed in an experiment is

the momenta of the particles you measure

the momentum of the particles you

measure the momentum of the incident

particle P of the proton note this is

the neutron

down here Neutron you measure the

momentum of the proton and what do you

know

you know the momentum of the W boson the

momentum of the W boson is the

difference of the momentum of the proton

and neutron see another momentum of the

W boson and of course that tells you the

momentum of the electron and neutrino by

momentum conservation you don't as a

rule well certainly not in these kind of

experiments actually no the distance

between those two points

you know the momentum but there's a

relationship between functions of

momentum and functions of position or

functions of distance and that

relationship is Fourier transform you

can think of the propagator either as a

function of positions or momentum you

can think of it as a function of either

position or momentum the position

distance between here and here or the

Fourier transform of this function the

Fourier transform of it is the amplitude

for emitting a W with a given momentum

so the question is what does the Fourier

transform of a function like this look

like I'm not going to work it out this

is something you can go and study for

yourself a function which has a power

law and then a sudden decrease like that

I will simply tell you what the Fourier

transform of the propagator is the

Fourier transform is a function of the

square of the momentum of the W boson

and also parametrically it depends on

the mass of the W boson let's call it

delta twiddle twiddle stands for Fourier

transform and it's a function what

should we call a momentum of the W let's

call it K

what does it look like it's very simple

1 divided by K squared plus the mass of

the W squared

that's it that's the factor that's the

fact that you put in if you know that

momentum of the W and how would you know

it by measuring the initial and final

momentum of the proton and neutron you

measure the momentum of the W and then

you insert this factor in as one of the

factors into the amplitude for the

emission of the W that's the rule

that's fine mins rules and that's it the

addition first of all let's talk about a

photon if we emit a photon it has no

mass and it's just 1 over K squared

typically when you emit a photon in

ordinary quantum electrodynamics the

momentum of the photon is pretty low by

particle physics standards it's

typically you know a few few hundred

electron volts or something like that

it's a very small K and so the

propagator for emitting the photon at

low momentum is rather large at low

momentum this is a big number as K goes

to zero the weak interactions we know

that the probability of emission is much

much smaller as I said it is not the

coupling constant there so the only

thing it can be is the mass of the W

boson if the mass of the W boson is very

large for whatever reason then this is

always going to be small in fact the

biggest it will ever be is what happens

when K is equal to 0 when K is equal to

0 this propagator here is equal to just

1 over M W squared and it's never bigger

than that that's as big as it gets

so the most likely thing to happen is to

emit a low momentum W and if you do it

cost you a probability amplitude equal

to one divided by the mass of the W

squared this is standard quantum field

theory in addition there are the

coupling constants so the net result is

that the probability or the amplitude

not the probability the amplitude for

emitting

a aw and having it convert to an

electron neutrino is GW squared pi

divided by M W squared the MW squared is

the factor in this Fineman diagram for

the W to go from here to here or at

least that's the biggest decay year yeah

there's regular propagator is the K

squared part has minor signs and D not

spread - cables Wow this is true this is

true arm where okay so there we have to

get a little more technical ah and that

mostly comes into play op the the very

little energy is emitted in a situation

like this and more momentum than energy

so it's mostly space like which means

it's positive the reaction you would

have to worry about this if if the

momentum of this was time like but it's

not in these kind of processes but still

the main thing is that it's always small

why is it small a proton becomes in a in

a beta decay the amount of momentum

that's transferred from the proton to

the from the neutron to the proton is

miniscule by comparison with the mass of

the W boson

menisci oh it doesn't even matter

whether it's positive or negative the K

squared it's tiny by comparison with the

with the mass of the W so the net result

is that the weak interactions are made

weak because of the large mass of the W

how large is it about a hundred times

the mass of a proton so that means that

that the amplitude the amplitude for

this process is going to have a factor a

relatively small factor from G W squared

roughly the fine-structure constant and

then a one over m W squared which is a

tiny fraction that's squared the mass of

the W is a hundred times the proton mass

that's a factor of 10,000 but that's

just the amplitude we have to square the

whole thing to find the probability for

the reaction to happen so what does that

mean that means something like G W to

the fourth divided by M W to the fourth

that's a very small number that's a very

small number if the mass of the W is

large

that's why weakened directions are small

not because the primordial coupling

constant is small but because the mass

of the W for whatever reasons happens to

be large in nuclear physics or in proton

Neutron type mass units unusual units of

nuclear physics or old particle physics

the mass of the W is large

well GW squared is about though 10 to

the minus 3 or something and then the

mass of the W is a hundred in proton

units so that's a 10 to the 4 millions

at least from the weakness of the weak

interactions right so right so

originally all it was known from

experiment was this combination what was

known was that combination and it was

called capital G Fermi experimentally

what you measure is neither or by now of

course there are fancier experiments but

the experiments in the old days are

where you never had enough momentum to

make this denominator very very much you

didn't get to see that the mother that

the denominator was was varying with

momentum all you saw was this numerical

constant and it was always the same W

boson in there it didn't change from one

reaction to another there was always the

W boson there's always M W squared and

so experimentally all you knew is this

number G Fermi which is a small number

okay a very small number whatever it's

whatever it's whatever it's numerical

value is its it carries dimensions so if

I told you what is in sum what should I

tell you in units of light-years per

unit

whatever its small number um right so

that's what was known historically some

time in nineteen spin 1950s various

theorist Julian Schwinger other people

began to suspect look maybe the weak

interactions are similar to other

interactions and mediated by some sort

of particle I don't know where that I

don't know where the terminology W came

from probably stood for a week and I

don't know if it was Schwinger or not

who first used it but the idea of a

particle heavy enough that it would make

this a small number was introduced some

time I think in the 50s but it was

recognized pretty much from the

beginning that it would take a pretty

heavy particle a hundred times the mass

of the proton and so it wasn't until

accelerators came into being where you

could generate that much energy

mid 70s late 70s where accelerators

which could create enough energy to

generate a W particle actually detected

it and actually measured it so yeah the

W particle really exists it can be

produced in there now so the beginning

of the class they talked about the

effect of the vining energy which me in

this picture is the presence of

nearby proton suppresses this this whole

process where a Marxist messaging the

president's on the field of the nearby

proton in Europe in other words they

only suppresses it because of energy

conservation nothing else a thing can't

happen if there isn't a better energy

available for it to happen so that's

another thing which controls rates yeah

okay

rates are controlled by three things or

about three things coupling constants

masses of particles in intermediate

states like this and also available

energy available energy has to do with

the energy of the initial state and the

final state there are three different

features coupling constants masses or

propagators if you like the structure of

propagators and how they depend on

momentum and finally a thing can't

happen if there isn't enough energy and

it will happen with very small

probability if the energy available is

small enough so you need the initial

state to have as much energy as the

final state in order for the process to

happen and it's the last of the

ingredients there that had to do with

the suppression of the deuteron decay

reciprocated yeah

these coupling constants are constant

very that we will come to that with

momentum but distance scale yeah well a

real W boson laboratory has a lot of

mass when it degrades into a electron

and a mule whatever right what happens

to that energy the electron the energy

of the final state must be the same as

the energy of the initial state that

means there isn't really enough energy

to create the W boson there really isn't

enough energy to create the W boson

that's why there is no real process in

where a W boson goes flying off there

simply isn't enough energy for that well

so what does happen the W boson is

produced virtually according to the

rules of quantum mechanics a violation

of energy can take place as long as it

takes place for a short enough time if

the amount of extra energy that's in

here let's call it Delta e energy time

uncertainty principle says among other

things that an apparent and apparent

violation of energy conservation Delta e

can only last for a time delta T which

cannot be bigger than just smaller that

in this case clocks constant you cannot

have an apparent violation of energy in

an intermediate state that lasts for a

time longer than Delta e delta T of

water h-bar let me give you another

example of this sort of thing if you

have a potential ordinary potential

energy this potential energy could be

the potential energy of an alpha

particle in a nucleus an alpha particle

is stuck in the nucleus it can't get out

why not

doesn't have enough energy to get out it

has to go over a bump to get out so the

alpha particle normally sits over here

but it can tunnel out quantum

mechanically it can tunnel out now the

kinetic energy of a particle is always

positive right in here it has a certain

amount of energy it has a much higher

potential energy over here this is a

potential a ordinary potential function

the potential energy is up here the

particle started at rest that had no

kinetic energy and had this much

potential energy it has the same amount

of potential energy over here and the

same and is also when it comes out over

here it also comes out of rest comes out

over here at rest was at rest over here

same potential energy same potential

energy so it can happen on the other

hand if you look at it in between it

seems that it had a large potential

energy much larger than it had over here

and it can't have less kinetic energy

that I've had over here the kinetic

energy was over it was zero over here

the meaning of that is that it

temporarily apparently violated energy

conservation now if you went and

measured the particle in here and

checked whether it was in here or not

you would destroy the phenomena of

tunneling but if you just look on the

outside you will have to say somehow in

the intermediate state here the electron

had more energy than it was both alpha

alpha particle had more energy than it

was supposed to have there was a

violation of energy conservation and

apparent one how long can the alpha

particle last under this barrier here

the answer is it can't last long and the

rule is if the violation of energy

conservation

this over here delta e then it had

better get out from under there and a

time delta t which is less than h-bar

over delta e alright so this is a kind

of familiar thing from elementary

quantum mechanics that apparent

violations of energy conservation can

take place as long as they last

sufficiently short time same thing over

here

there is the W boson is a very heavy

particle there is simply not enough

energy in the neutral proton Neutron or

anything else to create a W boson let

alone have enough energy to for the

final particle that cannot happen what

can happen is that temporarily for a

very very short time period the neutron

can emit the w w- become a proton but

then but then it is as if the alpha

particle were under the barrier here the

W boson says I can't last that long I

better get rid of all that energy and it

can do it a number of ways one way it

can do is just by getting reabsorbed

okay the other way I can do it is by

becoming the electron which has a small

energy and the anti neutrino which also

has a small energy so the intermediate

state here of a very very heavy W boson

is very much like the intermediate state

in which the alpha particle is under the

barrier here and it can only last a

short time yeah

any other no no no no and in even energy

conservation from initial to final state

is always exact it's just an apparent

violation

you would have here as though they

reabsorption what happens all the time

basically that fella comes out from the

back

most of the terms are around every once

in a while every once in a billion tries

it was that far enough to reach a itself

that's right that's correct

I've heard most of the time we have a

celebrated caller - really yeah yeah now

the W's will decay to electrons and

neutrinos but if you make a W with

enough energy all right there's a

certain life time for a real W to decay

it's at it's not this it's not this

uncertainty time here there is a certain

life time so the W when it's produced

will eventually decay but the faster the

W is the more time dilation will cause

the W to decay later and later

so real w's are produced and the meaning

of real w's is that you produce things

which whose decay decay probability is

controlled by their velocity in the

standard relativity way ah boy okay

very short very short the W hmm three

times 10 to the 27th - is it true

you said the common constant is the

probability okay how does it translate

into a right or a time for that okay

it's the rate right this this is this is

the amplitude this is the amplitude for

the process the square of the amplitude

is a probability that's this and it's a

probability per unit time it's a

probability per unit time and so it's

inverse is related as related to the

lifetime it's inverse is related to the

lifetime and that's why this is a very

small number the lifetime is unusually

large in particle physics units so weak

lifetimes particles which can only decay

for one reason or another by weak

interactions have anomalously long

lifetimes and where do you trace it to

you trace it to the mass of the W now if

a process remember what this really was

it was K squared plus M W squared ah

well

right if you have enough energy and

enough momentum you can detect the fact

eventually that these rates here will be

momentum dependent in other words the

effective constant here won't be

constant it will depend on K and that of

course has been seen with great

precision

the tunneling process 30 delta-t kind of

velocity zero yeah but if you went in

there and try to detect the velocity you

destroy the cosmos maybe this end and

figure out the distance you can you can

construct something you can call a

velocity it would be misleading to think

of it as the velocity of a real signal

low it's not a signal blossom

we usually get any entertaining the

lifetime of the real w we calculated

this is let's shot so short the W boson

for example it has a number of ways of

the cane but one way it decay can decay

literally decay is into an electron

antineutrino and you can calculate the

Fineman diagram describing it has this

factor G in it W minus a factor G and

electron and antineutrino and you can

calculate that and yes you can compute

the lifetime of the W whatever it is

so sing to us on the question in the

case where in laboratory produce it ugly

goes on what happens to that energy they

look me dead electron that very little

no no the W when a real W decays it

produces an electron neutrino with

enormous kinetic energy very

relativistic right a W boson at rest

will become and there are other decay

modes I mean this is not the only decay

mode I can do a muon and a neutrino and

a number of different decay modes but if

it decayed to an electron neutrino they

would be very very relativistic

electrons virtual real particles are

simply the ones in the created initially

welder the particles which came in and

the particles which went out of a small

interaction region the virtual particles

are mathematical constructs which are

the internal particles in a Fineman

diagram you don't observe them if you

went into the if you if you suddenly try

to observe that particle how would you

observe that particle the only way you

could observe it would be send something

else into the system okay let's let's

talk about trying to observe particles

of this nature or even even before that

what about trying to observe what's

happening to an alpha particle as it

moves under there well obviously you

have only a very short time in to to

observe it so if you want to observe if

you want to know whether there was a

particle under here you would have to

interact with it on a very very short

time scale you know you would have a

very short time scale to get it if you

want to find out for example by looking

at it with a photon you will have to

send in a very very short wavelength

photon pulse

in particular the energy of that photon

pulse would have to be about that big

that's what this energy time uncertainty

principle says the same energy time

uncertainty principle gives you

information about the wavelength and the

energy of a photon that you would need

if you wanted to have a time resolution

good enough to see what was going on in

there all right so if you wanted to

actually see the motion of the alpha

particle from here to here which lasts a

time delta T you would have to hit it

with a photon whose energy was big

enough that it actually would knock the

the alpha particle into this region here

you supply you're supplying the energy

and it's one of these quantum mechanical

complementarity things that you think

something is impossible and so you try

to detect it and you find out in order

to detect it you have to do to the

system exactly that thing which you were

trying to prove does not happen right

this is this is quanta it's it's always

the same story and the same would be

true of virtual particles virtual

particles last a small time if you

wanted to get into the system and detect

one you would have to hit it with

something with enough energy that it

would actually create that particle if

you want to see the virtual W here how

much time you have very short so you hit

it with a photon of photon a

sufficiently small wavelength that guess

what it's got enough energy to actually

knock a W out of the system so you

actually see a W all right that's sort

of unsatisfying and frustrating you were

trying to prove one thing and you found

out that you had to do something to the

system which did to it exactly what

you're trying to prove didn't happen

always that way that's that's quantum

mechanics and much

not true not true if you're trying to

see for example okay so let's let's

first talk about something slightly

different do you ever get to see the

virtual photons that are present in a in

an electron well yeah if you hit the

electron hard enough you'll knock out

though you'll knock the electron out and

the photon will be left over so you do

get to see them in that sense you do get

to see the virtual photons if you do

exactly the experiment which puts in

enough energy to to see those virtual

let's come after the W same thing is

true if you have a proton that proton

can emit it W and become a neutron and

of course if there's nothing else around

that it doesn't decay then the W will

have to come back and be reabsorbed and

so you can think of a proton as a sort

of equilibrium between a proton and a

neutron with the W boson around it

constantly going back and forth between

the two of them between the two things

with a very very very fast oscillation

normally fast oscillation between the

two you want to see that W all you have

to do is hit it hard enough or the

photon that has a frequency which is

large enough that it can resolve the

short times that the W is out there and

guess what if you do hit a proton with a

high energy photon yes you will knock

out W so in that sense you get to see

them but then of course it becomes a

different process it becomes a process

in which the W is a final particle not

an intermediate one

Mongo's the neutron goes to proton you

can also have neutron goes to proton

goes to Neutron with a w the difference

is that this one would be a w+ and this

one would be able to - yes doesn't make

any sense to say that we did that

experiment if you're not going part out

as opposed to you created know you could

say either way yeah

language is one thing facts are another

thing the fact is at the end of the day

there will be a w flying out do you want

to interpret that as a w that was there

beforehand that you knocked out or was

it a newly created w well the

mathematics says that there will be a w

there one picture of it is that the w

was there and you jerked the neutron out

before it before the w had a chance to

get back and the mathematic supports

that i mean that there is a way of

thinking about the mathematics it says

that's what happens on the other hand is

this true if you all you ever get by

putting a definition is w part

well if I play in addition to the double

W particle here I get a double apart

what if I put in twice L energy you

still get down because okay but does not

imply somewhere in existence the W

because you always get double use well

you don't always kick double use

sometimes you get double use sometimes

you get double use sometimes you might

get 3w sometimes you may get when you

hit a particle hard enough you get all

sorts of junk when you hit a particle

really hard this is what I was trying to

tell you the other night you know when

you when you try to think about what is

elementary in what's not elementary it

gets very confusing because if you take

what you thought was a very elementary

particle

and you hit it really hard enough all

kinds of junk comes out and among the

junk that comes out might be chairs and

tables well you'd need a hell of a lot

of energy for that but you hit an

electron hard enough with a photon

really really really hard meaning to say

with much much more energy than for

example a mass of a proton mass or a

thousand protons for example and guess

what out of it will come protons

electrons all sorts of things every once

in a while one of those electrons will

stick to a proton and so you will

discover that inside an electron or

inside a proton is there's a hydrogen

atom the lesson is don't try to your

your mental picture of what comes out of

a system is necessarily what was in

there beforehand it's a little bit

different this in itself doesn't this in

itself doesn't the vacuum energy really

has to do with diagrams which are

disconnected from the rest of just

they're in the vacuum but the presence

of vacuum diagrams like this

okay so a vacuum diagram is something

which also viola apparently violates

energy conservation let's suppose this

were an electron an electron of the

photon two electrons necessarily have a

certain minimum amount of energy the

vacuum has no energy okay and so there's

a certain violation of energy in there

that means that that pair can only last

for a short time and say okay I would

like to see that pair so you send in

some very high frequency photon or a

pair of very high frequency photons from

opposite sides and guess what you

sometimes make electron positron pairs

with extra photon in them so you knock

the hell out of that vacuum fluctuation

and you discover you discover pairs

apart

oh no they're not dependent on

temperature they are dependent on the

particles that you're colliding having a

lot of energy all right so it's a good

question let's say what it has to do

with temperature when you have a system

at high temperature it simply means that

you have a lot of particles around with

high energy so that means that typically

at high temperatures there are enough

high energy particles to cause these

things to happen but just think of high

temperatures just having a lot of high

energy particles around if you have a

very small number of high energy

particles you won't think of that as

temperature you'll just say I have some

particles with large kinetic energy an

example of what temperature can do is if

you have the alpha particle bound inside

the nucleus like that and then you put

it into a temperature bath now I don't

mean a tempura I don't mean your bath

water temperature bath I mean

temperatures which are many M V's high

which is zillions and zillions of

degrees high but the effect of putting

it into temperature you can either think

of it as particles coming in and

colliding or you can just think of it as

thermal vibrations causing this alpha

particle to jiggle around and give it

enough temperature and sure enough it

will jiggle over the top sometimes so

yes these virtual processes can be

induced by temperature but temperature

is another way of just saying there's a

lot of high-energy particle

did you say that the vacuum could not be

attributed to the generation W plus T

the practice they are contributed

variable subtracting talked about the

dark incorporations vacuum fluctuation

the W entices some kind of a fluctuation

to vision without using partner without

using part I know it did but is there a

relationship between the W the W in this

diagram is a fluctuation but it's not a

fluctuation of a vacuum it's a

fluctuation of the proton the proton

sometimes fluctuates and makes a w and a

neutron that's you know a relative of

but not the same thing as saying arm and

electron a anti neutrino and aw let's

see that would be a w+ can sometimes

form a vacuum fluctuation it's another

process where there really isn't enough

energy for it to happen so what happens

in this virtual sense for a short period

of time and in that sense it's similar

to this but it's different but the same

rules apply to it it can only last for a

short time therefore if you want to get

into it and observe it you have to do it

with something which has very high

energy because of the uncertainty

principle and the result is the energy

is always enough if you if the energy is

high enough to see in there it'll also

be high enough to create those particles

you have enough energy actually really

sir

through the antineutrino is necessary

there conservationists fear yeah mm-hmm

but another way of saying it is that the

basic interaction is always be one

between electron neutrino and W all

right but yes it is

good coffee eat into a cake chocolate

cake body

well basically have an energy Wow just

one taco why only one chocolate cake

okay so how much what's the weight of a

chocolate cake weight of a chocolate

cake is if it's really good chocolate

cake dense it weighs a kilogram right

all right a kilogram is thousand grams

which is ten to the 8th plunk masses

okay 10 to the 8th plunk masses that's

right if you could accelerate a pair of

particles to 10 to the 8th plunk masses

with a very very very small probability

you might get a chocolate cake out dream

on Michael

or anything else

Dumpty's pull up using your charity if

you get electron is turning into chair

anti chair currently now if you take

that to an extreme shortest possible

time what would it be to mast out like a

plant over Parkman yes the point mass

which is about 10 to the minus 5 grams

no no the clock mass is not the heaviest

mass obviously not in touch here's a

shorter time plate planets and anti

planets galaxies powers if you collide

particles and energies much larger than

the plunk mass what you get I was going

to say 99 times out of 100 but let's

make it 99.999 endlessly out of or

whatever it is you'll get a black hole

okay but every once in a while with a

probability which is exponentially small

in the entropy of the black hole that

black hole will emit a chair instead

right how do I know that I know that

because the process of a chair falling

into a black hole as proud as possible

and therefore by time reversal

invariance the process of a black hole

emitting a chair must be possible so yes

every once in a while the black hole or

when I say every once in a while I mean

a very rare percentage of the times that

you do this experiment the black hole

will behave and a statistically

extremely unlikely way but all that

entropy is is statistics and basically

anything that can happen will happen

eventually and so yes everything can

come out of a black hole if you do the

process enough times so above so all of

this above the Planck energy scale has

to do with the proposition from black

hole virtual photons and then your

vehicles are bosons while they interact

with jelly bosons and post buying

individual virtual photons and virtual

will a language any other virtual Photon

okay virtual processor you directly well

save is another dummy with closed hiding

virtual W if they were the quality of

thing is above silence you want to know

- mm-hmm

your question well down a solid NC

state probabilistic

interact with each other no Lisa no

photons do interact with each other a

little bit

you know how they interact with each

other the fact that they're bosons is

not what says that they don't interact

with each other all zones fermions they

all interact no difference in that

respect the reason that the photon

doesn't seem to interact with other

photons let's let's see if we can trace

it down photons can scatter now

ordinarily in the laboratory two light

beams on scatter each other but two

photons can do the following a photon

can come in another photon can come in

and they can create an electron-positron

pair electron minus E Plus

electron-positron pair well if that can

happen then the opposite can happen an

electron-positron pair can become a pair

of photons and in fact it can happen as

a virtual process as a virtual process

and a lot of para photons can come in

and go out but scatter by means of an

intermediate state which is an

electron-positron pair okay now why

doesn't it happen in the laboratory with

ordinary photons and the answer is it

takes a certain though it takes a

certain amount of energy to create the

electron positron pairs right each

electron has a mass of what is it half

an MeV right just so these together take

an MeV of energy if the pair of photons

has energy very very much lower than

that then there is not enough energy for

the real creation of an

electron-positron pair but still it can

happen virtually but when it happens

virtually there are propagators in here

the same sort of deal as what happened

here when you have to supply extra

energy for the process to happen there

is always a cost in probability

typically the cost and probability is

somehow inverse to the amount of energy

that that you need to make the process

happen okay so this process doesn't

happen in the laboratory because in the

laboratory photon energies are always

vastly smaller than the mass of an

electron photon energies are what an

electron volt typical photon optical

photons are electron volta to the mass

of an electron is of order a million

electron volts and so typically the

photons don't have nearly enough energy

for this process to happen and when a

process when an intermediate process

happens which has to happen very fast it

comes and goes it's always at a cost of

probability so this process the

scattering is a very low probability

process at low energies on the other

hand if the photons hit with enough

energy to be able to create an

electron-positron pair they really do

interact with each other now I forget

what the original question was it had to

do with W bosons but the same thing same

thinking is true W bosons do interact

with each other I wasn't talking about

that type of interaction as talking

about

their statistical interaction because oh

they are bosons yes don't think it's not

an interaction it's just effective

beause of statistics um well let's put

it this way the effects of the

statistics fermion versus boson is only

interesting when you have a situation

where you create more than one particle

so more than one particle pretty well

knew each other pretty much in the same

state in most particle physics

experiments you create the particles

going off flying off in every direction

and it's very rare that you have two

particles of the same type going off and

pretty much the same direction in such a

way that it matters very much with the

fermions or bosons but yes I mean they

do interact statistically the same way

photons do W bosons will prefer to be in

the same state in the same sense the

photons preferred in principle you could

make a laser out over them don't the not

likely but in principle you could make a

system lays W bosons

if you call a weaver with color is no

it's oh no it's always three quarks one

red one green and one blue which makes

it white or colorless a black or white

I'm not sure but then

there's superpositions of some but the

proton is always wondered for green one

or is this earth place to bring out what

happens at the other end of the energy

spectrum like the bose-einstein

condensate where is that question is

this a place to fit it in or will we get

to it yeah we will get to it and we'll

get to it in the context of the Higgs

boson yeah

the Higgs boson is a place where

something like bozer condensation

happens all right I did have one nobody

has asked me so let me bring it up

myself what kind of group structure

could we imagine which would mix the up

quark in the down quark oh the up quark

and a down quark the charm quark and the

strange co-op just forget them just up

quark and down quark they go into each

other by W emission what group could we

be talking about how it's obvious we're

talking about su 2 there are two

elements here and one can go to the

other

that's the symmetry of the of the system

we're talking about us you two but how

many generators is this you to have good

has three generators each generator the

gauge bosons are in one-to-one

correspondence with the with the

generators in the group that's the way

it works the eight gauge bosons the

eight gluons there's one for each

generator of su 2 su 3 we only have two

gauge bosons W + + W - but we're trying

to postulate that this is a theory based

on the symmetry su - we're missing

something

and indeed we are we're missing one

gauge boson it is not the photon it is

not the Photon

it is closely related to the particle

called the Z boson on third member of

the W family W plus W minus and Z okay

we'll come to it next time please remind

me if I forget to talk about the

relationship between electric charge Z

boson su 2 and so forth we've got to

come to that but I wasn't I was going to

talk about it but it's getting too late

for now in fact it's getting a little

too late to do almost anything the other

thing I had intended to talk about

tonight was spontaneous symmetry

breaking let's talk a little bit about

spontaneous symmetry breaking just

qualitatively and we won't try to do

anything quantitative tonight just

qualitatively what is spontaneous

symmetry breaking

I think the best way to describe it is

by illustrating it

there's a famous illustration which is

in a sense spontaneous symmetry breaking

but if it helps you okay it does it's

actually somewhat correct the famous

example is people sit down to dinner and

around the large table and each person

has to the left of them a fork and to

the right of them a fork next person

left to them and rather than a fork and

nobody knows whether to go for the left

fork for the left for left fork or the

right fork and they sit there and they

sit there and they sit there and they

can't decide what to do until all of a

sudden one of them looks a little motion

toward the right fork and then they all

go for the right fork

there was nothing asymmetric to begin

with but there was a kind of instability

there was a kind of instability two

possibilities an instability and the

instability being such that when the

instability is kicked off the whole

universe so to speak suddenly goes one

way instead of the other way so I will

give you an example mathematical example

a ferromagnet is an example of

spontaneous symmetry breaking but let's

think let's start with a very simple

example the simple example is a bunch of

spins and the spins can either be all up

or all sorry the spins can either be up

or down for the moment it's not even

important that we're talking about

quantum mechanics these could be coins

classical coins and um the coins can

either be up or down

they laid out on the table in a lattice

there they are and as an interaction

energy between neighboring coins the

interaction energy is such that if a

coins if the neighbors are opposite for

example a heads and a tails that cost

energy in other words there's some kind

of force between the particles or the

spins or the coins so that if they're

opposite that costs some energy if

they're parallel it costs less energy so

they like to be parallel energetically

if they like to be parallel but parallel

can mean this way or this way anti

parallel can mean this way or this way

anti parallel cost more energy than

parallel okay now think about the state

of lowest energy what is the state of

lowest energy the state of lowest energy

is obviously all heads or all tails

there are two states of lowest energy

all heads are all tails which one is the

ground state

they're both ground States but now

supposing way far away off a hundred

miles away one of the spins is known to

be heads that one is asymmetric well

normally under most circumstances you

would say that one degree of freedom

very very far away has no effect on what

the properties of the ground state are

far away from that degree of freedom

that's a typical expectation it's

usually true it's almost always true

ordinarily but in this case that one

head will cause the ground state energy

to be different if they're all heads

than earth or all tails if they're all

heads then you'll save one unit of

energy and so in seeking its ground

state this

we'll tend to all heads rather than all

tails

once it's all heads then you can forget

you can once it's all heads then you can

start over again and say look the lowest

energy state of the system is all heads

it will cost me some energy to put a

tail in there because it has four

neighbors which are trying to make it a

head so the result is that this kind of

system although it started with a

symmetry it started with the symmetry

heads goes to tails and asymptotically

very very far away boundary conditions

or just a very very distant degree of

freedom will tip off a instability and

put the system into one of the many

possible in this case only two possible

ground states and once it's in that

ground state then the properties of what

goes on in here are determined by that

ground state in particular a tail will

cost you energy because of the presence

of all the heads this is the simple and

a primitive most primitive example of a

spontaneous symmetry breaking how is it

different than just an ordinary symmetry

breaking what would an ordinary symmetry

breaking be mean an ordinary symmetry

breaking or we can call an explicit

symmetry breaking would be a symmetry

breaking if heads had a different energy

than tails not pairwise energies but

just one head by itself supposing that

one head by itself had less energy than

a tail then of course it would be

completely obvious that the system would

in its lowest energy state be all heads

and so it would be also the case all

heads but there would be no second

ground state in which they were all

tails it would be biased by the energy

we'll be biased by the energy not the

one extra particle infinitely far away

but by the local things going on near

body okay so that would be a a bias

situation where heads and tails were not

equivalent to each other

we're not energetically the same and

it's not a spontaneous symmetry breaking

it's just no symmetry to begin with or

an explicit symmetry breaking is there

any difference between explicit symmetry

breaking and spontaneous symmetry

breaking yes there is there is one

phenomena that can happen when there's

spontaneous symmetry breaking that will

not happen if there's explicit symmetry

breaking the phenomenon is called domain

walls a domain wall is what happens if

far away out here very very far away you

insist along this line here that

everybody is heads now way out here

you'll assume that everybody is tails

what then is the state of lowest energy

and then the state of lowest energy is

everybody on the side tails everybody on

the side heads and a boundary in between

we're heads go from two we're tails go

too far from the boundary where you go

from tails - heads called domain wall so

the presence of domain wall and this

would not be the case if you had

explicit symmetry breaking if you had

explicit symmetry breaking then the

state of lowest energy would just be all

heads period wouldn't care that they

wouldn't care very much that you did

this thing over here so spontaneous

symmetry breaking in this case the

signal of it is the existence under

certain circumstances certain kinds of

experimental setups would lead to the

existence of domain walls where on one

side you had one thing on the other side

you had the other thing and so it would

be the presence of domain walls which

would be the signal that there was a

spontaneous symmetry breaking alright so

this is the basic idea of spontaneous

symmetry breaking a symmetry of the

system but with an instability or a

instability that you can kick off by

going very far away and just fiddling

with something very far away and that

will fix everything as I said the signal

or the signature of it is the existence

of domain walls next time we'll talk

about other kinds of spontaneous

symmetry breaking and come to the higgs

phenomenon the Higgs phenomena is a

phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry

breaking and we'll talk about it next

time so just keep just keep this example
