Stanford University you think I don't

know don't you know as a matter of fact

I do know and this what we're going to

talk about tonight and it's called the

phenomena what is it

pigs pigs thank you you started to cover

this last week and I didn't really you

describe what you were talking about is

giving mass to the photon yes that's

what we're going to talk about tonight

we don't actually give mass the photon

so what no no that's that's right that's

right the real photon the symmetry group

associated with it is not spontaneously

broken tonight we're going to talk about

how if the symmetry group associated

with the photon were broken

spontaneously how it would give the

photon of mass now the reason we're

doing that is because exactly that

phenomena happens with the Z boson and

the W bosons the photon is or

the photon is a little bit simpler

indeed it might have had a mass the fact

that it doesn't have a mass is perhaps

an accident of nature the absence of an

appropriate Higgs field we're going to

talk about what the Higgs field is to

give it mass so that's what we want to

talk about tonight

how gauge bosons like the photon get a

mass when spontaneous symmetry breaking

what is the symmetry incidentally when I

say you associated with the photon

there's a conserved quantity which is

the charge conserved quantities always

go with symmetries what's the symmetry

that's connected with the conservation

of electric charge you want it's the

thing which multiplies the charged

fields by a phase it is a kind of

rotation in the complex plane the

complex field so I'm going to explain to

you tonight how spontaneous symmetry

breaking of that symmetry

induces a mass for the photon now there

is a situation in nature where the

photon does get a mass and the symmetry

of you on symmetry is spontaneously

broken does anybody know what it is well

it is a kinetics condensed matter yes

okay the answer is in a superconductor

in a superconductor photons propagate

with a mass now that's in the

superconductor when they leave the

superconductor their photons again when

they're in the superconductor they

behave as if they had a mass okay so

that's an example of the Higgs phenomena

or and we can talk about it yeah that'd

also be the case when the photon is

travelling through something present a

vacuum well the super conductivity only

happens when the photon is traveling

through something other than the vacuum

no no super conductivity or the photon

no no no the photon does not propagate

with a mass in a prism its velocity is

slower than the speed of light but it's

still true that at zero momentum meaning

infinite wavelength its frequency is

zero okay let's talk about the

difference that's an interesting

difference might as well talk about it

the relevant issue is the shape of a

certain curve the curve is

either energy versus momentum or for

waves what corresponds to momentum for

waves either inverse wavelength or wave

number K everybody remember K K is

basically the inverse of the wavelength

and vertically what we have instead of

energy now the K is like P vertical here

was energy frequency frequency Omega

alright remember e equals H bar Omega

and P equals H Bar K all right so K is

wave number the number of waves that fit

into a given into a unit the distance

all right so this these two planes are

the same except for a fact of H bar all

right what is what is Omega versus K

look like for an electromagnetic wave in

empty space well what's the connection

between Omega and K Omega equals C times

K that's it Omega equals C times K now

the same relationship incidentally is

true of sound waves waves on a long

string and so forth approximately the

same relationship the difference of

course is they have different velocities

of propagation but notice that Omega is

zero when K is zero that means on this

side over here that the energy is of a

quantum or light or wave the energy is

zero when the momentum is zero what do

we call a particle when its energy is

zero and then when the energy is zero if

its mass is zero we call it what we call

it photons yes but we call it massless

all right so any wave which has the

property that Omega goes smoothly to

zero as K goes to zero we call massless

and typically the shape

of the curve looks like that taken be

positive and negative corresponding to a

wave going to the left or the right

let's forget going to the left okay

the frequency goes to zero when the

wavelength becomes infinite

that's massless and all that happens in

a prism is that sea changes see changes

okay now what about um what about a

particle with mass for particle of mass

its energy is equal to the square root

of P squared plus M Squared now there's

some C's there I think there's a C to

the fourth and no C squared C squared

nimbala C squared P squared plus M

Squared C to the fourth right but if we

set C equal to 1 it's the square root of

P squared plus M Squared what does that

look like that's a curve which looks

like this it's a hyperbola

in fact if we Square this we get e

squared let's set C squared to one e

squared minus P squared equals M squared

that's a hyperbola you see the

difference in this case when P goes to

zero the energy is not zero that's the

rest mass or just a mass if you like the

rest mass is the value of the energy

when the momentum goes to zero all right

so are two different situations one the

velocity of light may be different in a

prism than it is an empty space but that

just changes the slope of this curve and

does not change the fact that the energy

is zero at the origin here the other

situation is that the energy is not zero

at the origin and has this hyperbolic

shape that's called having a mass and

notice that there's a frequency same

thing here that a wave with infinite

wavelength as

finite frequency what does infinite

wavelength mean it means you disturb the

field every place the same you rigidly

you make the field

absolutely homogeneous homogeneous means

it's everywhere is the same you shift

the field everywhere and you let it go

what happens is everywhere as it starts

to oscillate simultaneously that's the

phenomenon over here infinite wavelength

zero wave vector the whole field

oscillates it also corresponds to

particles at rest

oscillating because they have mass okay

all right so that's what the important

thing to keep in mind is that

oscillations of a field when it's

homogeneous when it has infinite

wavelength those are the things we call

mass as answer the question about the

wave numbers it changes changes it what

was moving through a soft solid right

you can have any way Harper I mean if

you take took away a ray and run it into

it into a piece of glass it's not the

Omegas exchange that's right if you if

you have a wave of a given frequency and

it shines on a piece of glass the

frequency doesn't change when it goes

into the into the into the material but

as I think you're for seeing two

different materials might have a

different slope here so at the same

value of frequency you would jump from

one you could jump from one wave number

to another and that's what happens

this situation where the entire field

shifts would that be equivalent to tae

seop's entanglement Yamuna nor a little

entanglement this is a perfectly

classical wave field and I I understand

that but what I'm saying is entanglement

says that this particle over here and

this particle over here responds

instantaneously and by the entire field

ship and leave that no doubt / no no

entanglement is a situation where you

have two particles in two different

states which are entangled with each

other a over here B over here or a over

here B over here after they have to be

in it has to be two different states

spin up and spin down spin down and spin

up a classical field is when all of the

particles are in the same state it's

quite thick yeah it's all in curve that

you drew but that looks more like PE and

it W what is what does that represent

yeah great this is Corki the

relationship between Omega and K between

frequency and wave number is called the

dispersion relation you say there's no

dispersion when Omega is a linear

function of K when Omega is a linear

incidentally the slope of this curve is

the velocity the Omega decay is a yeah

the Omega DK is the velocity of the wave

okay so if the slope of this is constant

everywhere is then all waves move with

the same velocity

all right that's light always move of

the same delight the same velocity if

the slope varies from place to place for

example as it would if there was a mass

then different wavelengths propagate

with different velocities in that case

the wave will disperse so it's called

the dispersion relation let's let's name

it now Omega the Omega as a function of

K that relationship is called the

dispersion relation of the

so the words go that a massless

expectation is one with a linear

dispersion relation a massive particle

is one with a dispersion relation that

does not go to 0 as K goes to 0 but has

a curvature and shape like that and the

mass is nothing but the energy of the

quantum when the momentum is zero so

that's M energy of a quanta quantum as a

function of the momentum when the

momentum goes to zero is the mass all

right so that's a that's the notion of

mass and it is connected with the

curvature of the potential energy of the

field at the or the curvature of the

potential energy at the equilibrium

point wherever the equilibrium point

happens to be why because if you shift

the field away from the equilibrium

point let's say everywhere is

homogeneous Lea everywhere is the same

what happens is it starts to oscillate

about there it's pulled toward lower

energy and overshoots goes up and goes

back and that corresponds to Omega not

being zero at k equals zero K equals

zero means you shift the field

everywhere simultaneously homogeneous

lee all right so we take the field and

we shift it everywhere simultaneously

and the frequency at that point is the

mass if the frequency is zero and the

only way the frequency will be zero is

if the potential energy is flat as a

function of the field if the potential

energy happens to be flat and you shift

the field away from the minimum here

it's not a minimum anymore it's just a

flat directions called a flat direction

of all things it's called a flat

direction if you shift the field along a

flat direction it won't respond it will

just sit there so that corresponds to

the homogeneous field K equals zero

having no energy no frequency

frequency zero all right so you spot a

massless object when there's a direction

a flat direction of the potential here

the flat direction of the potential is

going around the rim on the other hand

if you excite the field perpendicular to

that it oscillates and so this pretend

this kind of field has two distinct

kinds of quanta associated with it

one massless one mass massive what's the

mass of one called in the context of the

standard model incidentally massive the

Higgs boson okay so oscillating this way

we would call the Higgs boson and it has

a mass what about oscillating this way

that's the Goldstone boson its massless

but there is no massless Goldstone boson

in nature so something happened to it

and the parlance of high energy physics

the Goldstone boson got eaten by the

gauge boson resulting in giving the

Higgs boson a mass so that's the

phenomenon that we want to do

mathematically tonight the Goldstone

boson eaten by the gauge boson resulting

in a mass for the Higgs boson okay

remember the Goldstone boson is the one

associated with a motion around here the

Higgs boson is the one associated with

us over here okay so let's let's go

through it there's mathematics to this

if I could do it without mathematics I

would but I can't so we're going to do

it with mathematics and we've already

set up the ingredients we've already set

up the basic ingredients for it all we

have to do is combine them together

so that means in a standard bottle

there's only one spontaneous symmetry

breaking and that's the Higgs field no

it's not a simple you one symmetry it's

this su 2 symmetry of the weak

interactions that take ups to downs and

neutrinos to throw electrons so it's a

little more intricate than just the u 1

symmetry breaking the gauge was getting

mass to everything including yourself

including itself yeah yes well no no no

no no yes and no yes or no okay so let's

let me tell you what the point is there

are a collection of particles in the

standard model which for one

mathematical reason or another cannot

have any mass unless the symmetry is

spontaneously broken now we're going to

go through those regions or reasons

we're going to go through them for

various particles and see what the

reasons are why mass is disallowed by

the standard model without spontaneous

symmetry breaking

then when spontaneous symmetry breaking

happens all of those particles get mass

and they become the masses of the

standard of the standard model particles

they might ask why what about particles

it didn't require a spontaneous symmetry

breaking to get a mass are there any

particles that don't require a

spontaneous symmetry breaking to get a

mass and the answer is yes they can be

those particles are all the particles

that we don't see in the laboratory why

would it be that we would see those

which symmetry breaking gives a mass and

we don't see those

that symmetry breaking doesn't give a

mass any any speculations of why why

that might be yeah yeah yeah the natural

mass might be way up at the Planck scale

the natural masses of particles may be

very much larger leaving over a bunch of

particles which don't have masses for

what you're calling natural reasons and

those particles only get mass from

spontaneous symmetry breaking those

particles are the light ones those are

the ones we see in the laboratory we

have every reason to believe and in fact

I think we practically know by now

that there are additional particles in

nature for example the dark matter

particles we don't know with absolute

certainty what the dark matter particles

are but it seems very likely that the

dark particle dark matter particles are

particles a thousand times heavier than

a proton for example why is it that

those particles have large mass and the

other ones don't and the answer is in

the mathematics of the theory those

particles which have large mass don't

require the phenomena of spontaneous

symmetry breaking to get a mass so we're

going to go through that that's my goal

for tonight and if we don't make it

through it entirely next time the Higgs

phenomena and what the words mean the

Higgs particle gives such and such a

mass are the first class of particles

which cannot have a mass unless the

spontaneous symmetry breaking are the

analogs of the photons the gauge bosons

so tonight I'm going to try to show you

how the photon gets a mass from

spontaneous symmetry breaking down

spontaneous symmetry breaking let's

begin with a boson field Phi we did this

last time but since since it's a subtle

and difficult concept let's do it again

and Phi is a complex field that means

there's a five star to go along with Phi

and we can write Phi in two ways by real

plus I Phi imaginary what does it

correspond to it comes

and what I would do before I real fire

imaginary all we can write it as Phi

equals Rho e to the I alpha where Rho is

the distance along here it's not a real

distance in space at the distance in

field space and alpha is the angle two

different ways polar coordinates and

Cartesian coordinates for the field now

are incidentally five-star is of course

Phi real minus I Phi imaginary and it's

also equal this one here is also equal

to Rho e to the minus I alpha Rho and

alpha are functions of position this is

a field so these are functions of

position and as you can see in either

case there are two fields the real field

and imaginary field or the radial field

and the angular field you might begin to

guess about the connection between Rho

alpha and the two kinds of motions that

can take place here alpha corresponds to

exciting the angular modes if you vary

alpha from place to place

it's like varying around the circle if

you vary Rho it's like moving radially

back and forth which one do you think

gets a mass Rho which one doesn't get a

mass alpha which one is the higgs-boson

Rho which one is the Goldstone boson

alpha good you got it you that's that I

hardly have to go through the

mathematics now no no really

that's the mathematics is now the the

the trick in going through the

mathematics is to write the lagrangian

for this field it's derivative of v star

times the derivative of phi this of

course means time derivative squared

minus space derivative squared but I'll

just write it that way derivative of Phi

with respect to space and time as for

vectors dotted into each other that's

the gradient terms in the energy and you

can work them out in terms of Phi and

Phi star I'll tell you where they are

this becomes derivative of Phi real

squared plus derivative of Phi imaginary

squared in other words it just behaves

as if there were two independent fields

real and imaginary or we can write it in

terms of Rho and alpha and this would

become I'll write it down for you you

can work it out yourself derivative of

Rho squared and then plus Rho squared

times the derivative of alpha squared

Rho is the magnitude of the field alpha

is the angle but each of these are

fields and this is what Lagrangian is

you can either think of it in one way or

the other no problem now let's add in a

potential energy the potential energy

I'm going to assume is symmetric

symmetric with respect to rotations in

this plane in other words that it really

does have a u 1 symmetry for a potential

energy to have a u 1 symmetry it means

it's only a function of Rho equivalently

it's only a function of Phi star Phi it

does not depend on the angle so let's

write that plus V of Rho that also

corresponds well okay

vr Rho let's take actually the potential

always comes in with a minus sign in the

Lagrangian so let's put it in with a

minus sign a simple case would be Rho

squared an energy which increases

quadratically away from the origin

that's a possibility let's think about

that possibility Rho squared it's not

really what I it's a possible Express

um what would that correspond to in

terms of 5real and Phi imaginary just

Rho squared Phi real squared plus Phi

imaginary squared that's the Pythagorean

theorem Rho squared is five real squared

plus Phi imaginary squared so if the

potential was the very simple form of

quadratic we would add here Phi real

squared or minus subtract not important

Phi real squared plus Phi imaginary

squared notice Lagrangian would actually

be the sum of two terms

one for Phi real and one for Phi

imaginary and both of them would have a

mass term there could be a coefficient

here M Squared over 2 let's say then you

will have this situation which I drew

over here where both directions of

oscillation correspond to a mass and

they're quite independent of each other

they don't even couple to each other

they really talk to each other just two

separate fields one that I label Phi

real the other one I label Phi imaginary

now there could be more complicated

things here which would couple them

together but this is the basic picture

if the potential looks like this but

what if the potential looks like this

that's also a function of Rho but it

would be inconvenient to represent it in

terms of fire we landfire imaginary

especially since the minimum is stuck

out here away from the origin the

coordinates Firewheel and phi imaginary

are not obviously the best coordinates

when you stuck out here better

coordinates are the angular coordinate

and the radial coordinate

why because they correspond to two

different kinds of oscillations with two

different frequencies in other words

just think of this as a function of Rho

and alpha now this potential energy

doesn't depend on alpha at all okay but

it does depend on Rho it depends on Rho

in a way which is minimized when Rho is

equal to F

and in fact it takes a good deal of

energy to displace it away from F so

it's natural to write that row what's

it's natural to write that row is equal

to F plus a bit of fluctuation in other

words the minimum energy is when Rho is

stuck at F anyways along here Rose stuck

at F but you can displace it a little

bit and let's represent that

displacement away from F by a letter of

the alphabet and I'm going to choose the

next letter of the alphabet after F

which is h h4 what h figs okay

h4 eggs so the Higgs field is just the

displacement of the radial direction or

the radial part of the field away from

its equilibrium all right now

it caused a good deal of energy to

excite this Higgs field why because it's

got a potential in that potential might

be rather sharp in fact it is rather

sharp so um to some approximation some

rather good approximation we may say

that the low energy behavior is as if

Rho were frozen at value F now this is a

very common thing in physics to say that

there are low energy excitations low

energy oscillations of a system low

frequency oscillations and high

frequency oscillations and ignore the

high frequency oscillations that would

be equivalent to ignoring H here just

saying Rho is equal to F plus something

that takes too much energy for us to

worry about today we'll worry about it

another day when our accelerators have

more energy okay what would this look

like then well Rho is stuck at F we

might as well ignore its derivative okay

more what about V of Rho V of Rho is

just V of F so V is stuck at the minimum

if it's stuck at the minimum it doesn't

doesn't vary from place to place this

and this are irrelevant to the dynamics

of the angular field furthermore since

it costs so much energy to make a bit of

H we can just approximately say that Rho

is equal to F and we find that for the

low energies for the small energy

excitations that the Lagrangian is just

F squared a number times the derivative

of alpha squared there is no potential

energy associated with alpha why is it

no potential energy associated with

alpha for the obvious reason that we

don't gain any potential energy when we

go around the angular direction all

right we this is a little bit less

familiar because it has this F in it but

we could redefine the field we could

redefine the field by inventing a new

field call it beta beta is equal to F

times alpha it's just a rescaling of the

field just a redefinition and then we

would rewrite this as just the Alpha

that's already beta squared

no mass term no mass term because it

doesn't cost any energy to displace the

field homogeneous ly everywhere no mass

term and so alpha or beta depending on

which you want to write is a massless

field it is the Goldstone boson and as I

said what its energy corresponds to is

slow variations of the fields you vary

the field from place to place slowly you

get a little bit of energy if you vary

it slowly enough you get a little bit of

energy from the derivative terms here

but no potential energy so that's the

hallmark of a massless particle and it's

the Goldstone boson

Goldstone bosons are the massless

particles which are the consequences of

the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a

continuous symmetry okay that's the

buzzwords ah that's half the story

that's the spontaneous symmetry breaking

half together with the Goldstone boson

phenomenon the other half of the story

which also has to do with varying the

phase of a field from point to point is

the gauge invariance so I want to spend

a little bit of time I'm going to give

you a break for a few minutes then we're

going to review again what I told you

last time about gauge invariants that

should take us another 15 20 minutes or

10 minutes I'm not sure and then put the

two of them together and see what comes

out okay and what will come out will be

that the Goldstone boson is eaten by the

gauge boson giving the Higgs boson a

mass no giving giving the Higgs boson a

mass and also giving the gauge boson

embarrass ya cuz I'm confused whether

Rho is the radius in the complex plane

or is the field that at a radius in the

complex I know the field is a point in

the complex plane the value that a field

takes on is a point in the complex plane

at every point in space the field has a

value which is the complex point in the

plane

in other words at one point in space the

field is three plus I times or six and

another point in the plane that's pi

plus I times e someplace else it's uh

the Euler macaroni number plus so I

times the small of its number explain

that is except we said instead what's

radially symmetric now the value of the

field at a point is not radially

symmetric the value of the field at a

point is the value of the field at a

point it's not radially symmetric it's

the point on the complex plane what's

radially symmetric is the potential

energy the potential energy is only a

function of this squared plus this

squared three six the field at some

point has the value over there at some

other point in space the field takes on

the value over here some other point it

takes on the value over here the

potential energy is only a function of

the size of the square but 3 + i6 if the

value of the field and ink doesn't say

anything about where an accomplished a

had occurred through 3

the value of the field in X plus iy is

not a sin the value at X plus iy the

value of the field is x and y are not

positions of space this is not the field

at the point x and y this is the field

whose value is a point in the complex

but it's an abstract idea fields or

fields can be complex they can be real

they can be multi-component you can

assemble them together if they have two

components into a into a complex

variable so the field itself is a

complex variable it's a complex variable

where as you move around in space the

field takes on different values on this

complex plane get used to that idea

fields don't just have to be numbers

they can be complex numbers they can be

multi-ball start pushing is innocent

where oh yeah make sure they're going in

the mass hold Russian

if you give it a big enough displacement

won't or go into the other

yah-yah-yah means you're too hard on

pickleball in our swing around

it's just that manifest itself well the

problem is that the amount of energy

that would be involved for the Higgs

field is way beyond the energy that that

even a big accelerator can so it's it's

out of the ballpark from even the LHC

but yes I mean in principle you could

give the give the feel to get big enough

knock to knock it over the top not

everywhere simultaneously in space that

would be an enormous amount of energy

but in some reason yeah but is that

exactly in line with the peak of the day

I want to go off and wind up all right

so it's very unlikely right that's

that's right yeah I would make a bit

would make a monstrous splash of some

kind going off and on let's take out

let's take a 10-minute break okay let's

get let's go through again what we mean

by a field as a function of space and

what this idea of a field which is a

complex variable is just to make it

clear once more we have space x y&z

right all right now we can have fields

in space let's say scalar fields you can

have a scalar field in space which now

what characterizes it as being a scalar

it means it doesn't change when you

rotate coordinates that's all it means

it doesn't change not when you rotate

the coordinates we're talking about here

when you talk rotate the coordinates of

real space it doesn't change that's what

a scalar field is now you can have

several scalar fields let's say in

particular you can have two scalar

fields let's give them names let's call

them Phi I and Phi are the two scalar

fields are you can then assemble them if

you like

this is totally a matter of convention

it's totally a choice it's a useful

Jois it's one of these things in

mathematics which sometimes are really

just useful conventions and this is one

of them in fact the whole idea of

complex numbers is a useful convention

it's a useful convention for

representing pairs of numbers that's all

and the pairs of numbers are called the

real and imaginary parts of the numbers

X not a little bit a column X X stands

for space okay but just real and

imaginary our components are just ways

of speaking about pairs of real numbers

now it is a little more than pairs of

real numbers more structure that goes

into the into the complex numbers but

you know fundamentally it's a way of

talking about pairs of numbers you can

plot pairs of numbers on the Cartesian

plane the Cartesian plane is not real

space it's just a Cartesian plane in

which you've plotted the real and

imaginary parts of complex numbers if I

had two fields two scalar fields one of

which I called Phi real and the other

that's its name if I real and Phi

imaginary I can assemble them together

into a complex field yeah a complex

field and at each point of space there

would be a high real and if I imaginary

okay at each point of space I could go

and plot the value of the field on the

complex plane keep in mind the complex

plane is not space it's just an

auxiliary construction an auxiliary

construction which is useful in

replacing two real fields by one complex

symbol until it is it's a trick for

representing for cutting down the number

of equations that you write cutting it

in half basically by writing him as

equations for complex variables okay so

in that language you would say that the

scalar field the complex scalar field

I is that just that it's a complex

scalar field and at every point in space

real space it has a value that value is

not a single number it's a pair of

numbers why because it's a pair of

fields to begin with that pair of

numbers can be plotted so at this point

of so at this point of space over here

the field is over here at that point of

space the field is over here at that

point that's over here and so forth

that's the idea of a complex scalar

field sometimes the real and imaginary

parts are called the real and imaginary

components of the field but don't get

those confused with the components of a

vector field or a tensor field or the

components of a the gravitational field

those components have to do with

projections onto real space-time

coordinates this has to do with the

projections onto this fictitious

two-dimensional plane that's useful for

writing pairs of numbers now once you

realize that you can write the field as

a complex variable and plot it on the

two-dimensional plane like that then it

becomes a possible symmetry of nature or

possible symmetry of mathematics to

rotate the field in other words there

might be a symmetry which says that you

can real Abel or redefine Phi I and Phi

are by rotation and that happens when

there's when we have lagrangian's like

this which don't change when you do what

when you multiply Phi by e to the I

times of phase these are the class of

lagrangian's which don't change when

you're multiple when you rotate the

fields simultaneously everywhere in

space when you rotate it in this

fictitious plane in other words take the

field at every point of space and you

rotate its value you give a new value to

the field which is related to the old by

changing the angle here rigidly

everywhere in space then this Lagrangian

does not change we went through that

last

time and that's the basic idea of a

complex field with a symmetry with the

symmetry of called u 1 symmetry it's a

global symmetry that's called a global

symmetry a global symmetry is one way

you're not allowed to change the phase

angle in space in space you just rotate

it everywhere yep

so you can see that symmetry just by

looking at where what's a function of R

oh yeah well you can look at it in a

number of ways you can see that since

this has real squared plus imaginary

squared things in it when everything is

a function of real squared plus some and

this one yeah right right so this is a

function of Rho also you can see it here

incidentally what does the symmetry

operation do on Rho and alpha Rho stays

the same and alpha you shift it by a

constant namely the angle that you're

rotating the field by well shifting

alpha by a constant doesn't change its

derivatives right that's correct

right so all right now I think we have

the basic idea now let's go through

again all right now um yes let's go

through the idea of a gauge

transformation we went to it last time

so I'm just going to remind you we're

not going to spend a lot of time on it

and do as fast as we can but please ask

questions

it is not a symmetry of this Lagrangian

to multiply the field Phi by an

arbitrary function of position by an

arbitrary phase this is called a phase e

to the I times this times Phi of X of X

this is not a symmetry we went through

this last time we rewrote that

Lagrangian in terms of Phi Prime and

found out that it didn't have the same

form in other words the Lagrangian

written up there in particular the term

derivative of Phi star times the

derivative of Phi I don't have to put in

the indices mu here you know about that

that is not the same as the derivative

of Phi prime star derivative of v prime

not the same and therefore it is not a

symmetry okay

this is not a symmetry why that's

because when the derivatives act they

act not only on Phi but they act on

theta here they act on theta if theta is

variable if they didn't vary in space

then this would be a symmetry but if

theta varies in space it's not we work

that out in detail last time and I'll

show you in a moment what we found but

to make it a symmetry you have to add

another field a kind of compensating

field a compensating field that will

compensate for the changes in the

Lagrangian when you shift the phase of

the field ah keep in mind it's useful to

remember that shifting the phase of the

field is just adding a function to alpha

ok shifting the phase of the field is

adding a function Phi of X a dur of X to

alpha

it changes the phase angle Everywhere's

by amount theta right if theta is a

constant that's symmetry if theta is not

a constant it's not a symmetry in order

to make it a symmetry you have to add

another field and the other field is

called the vector potential it's a four

vector it has an index mu it's also a

function of position out of it you build

the electromagnetic field E and be your

electric and magnetic field the

transformation property when you do a

gauge transformation like this is called

the gauge transformation

in when you do a gauge transformation

you have to do something to a at the

same time in fact you have to take a

prime of X and set it equal to a of X

plus or minus I always get confused by

the signs here

I think it's plus the derivative this is

a mu of theta in other words you add to

a the gradient the space-time gradient

of theta if you do these two operations

together and you construct the right

kind of Lagrangian it will be invariant

under this operation if it's invariant

it's a symmetry so let me remind you how

it works

Oh incidentally oh that's good enough

hmm you're the mind is the list yeah Oh

rest of our minds I think I think the

idea is that a goes to a prime plus D mu

hey I'm just saying if you write it with

an arrow notation of the transformation

going from starting with a new and going

to what then you have a minus sign if

you don't if you write the

transformation as hey you goes to a new

plus D mu hmm okay then when you write

it in the eighth okay yeah yeah it's

just reading it the other way yeah right

all right but this is the transformation

that you make these are the prime

variables these are the unprimed and I

may have written it the opposite way

last time I don't remember but I will

compensate for any mistakes and not many

mistakes but any change of notation by

changing it consistently everywhere from

one week to another I don't remember the

precise notation but both of them you

know you can do it either way

equals del - del plus I a and D star

equals del - I a I may have changed I

may have inadvertently changed notation

but as long as you do it consistently

everywhere as it's fine okay so let's

now we've seen that the ordinary

derivative of Phi prime is not simply

related to the ordinary derivative of

Phi let's write out the relationship

let's take the derivative of Phi prime

derivative with respect to any axis I'll

stop writing muse and news the

derivative of Phi prime is first of all

equal to e to the I theta which is a

function of x times the derivative of

Phi if that's all there was and we did

multiply the derivative of the complex

conjugate of Phi by the derivative of

Phi the e to the I theta is we cancel

out right all right so if that's all

there was we'd be in fine shape we would

say there's a symmetry but there's

another term and the other term is Phi

times the derivative I times the

derivative of theta all times also e to

the I theta that's this term here which

is the nuisance if all there was was

something which carried and if theta

only entered through e to the I theta

here it would cancel out when we

multiply this by the complex conjugate

but theta comes into its derivative over

here that's the problem

okay all right to fix that problem

why should you want to fix it well it's

a fact of nature that there is a gauge

that there are gauge symmetries

that's also an interesting fact of

mathematics that such symmetries are

possible to make it possible you replace

the ordinary derivative by what's called

the covariant derivative this is a

mathematical concept that comes from the

theory of fiber bundles but I think it

was I don't know whether the theory of

fiber bundles was invented before or

after the notion of gauge invariance in

physics I have a feeling it was invented

afterwards but someone that's right I

think so yeah right I don't know but I

don't know what the mathematicians

invented it completely independently

through the value but I really don't

know in any case it is both a

mathematical and a physical concept and

in order to make the Lagrangian gauge

invariant you invent the new kind of

derivative it's called the covariant

derivative with respect to again with

respect to each direction of space or

time you write that this is equal to the

ordinary derivative

I think it's plus now I'm going to get

myself confused I'll try plus if it

doesn't work we'll change it plus I

times a times v now there is an implicit

index in here once more I will write it

just the number a is a vector derivative

plus multiplying by a sometimes this is

indicated by saying that derivative is

replaced by derivative plus I a but it

only makes sense if you apply it to a

complex field like Phi so this is the

definition of the covariant derivative

and if I were to write the covariant

derivative of Phi star it is by

definition just the complex conjugate so

it's equal to D mu Phi star

- I a mu five-star okay now I assert

easy to check is it a check that the

relationship between the covariant

derivative of five and the covariant

derivative of Phi prime is very simple

all you have to do is evaluate the

covariant derivative of what is the code

this is the covariant derivative of Phi

look let's write down with the covariant

derivative of Phi prime is well it's

exactly the same except you stick

Prime's Everywhere's D mu Phi prime is

just equal to D mu Phi plus I a prime

times Phi Phi Prime Thank You Phi Prime

everywhere is Phi prime v prime okay if

you stick Phi prime over here you're

going to wind up with this extra term

over here as if I were if I evaluate D

mu Phi Prime let me write it better be

mu Phi prime here it is let's see is

this right no what did I do here this

was D mu Phi prime right hmm five five

zero five no no no

yeah no no there's no difference between

capital and not capital so Greg unifies

are actually lowercase and when you use

the bars they are uppercase come

when you don't use the bars they're

lowercase footmark spies or cases hard

if you don't have them keep the I I bars

on the top and the bottom finds lower

case sorry we're tonight bar you know

those bars that you write on the top

yeah like those things upper case fine

yeah I'm just telling you there's no

distinction in my notation between upper

case and lower case sometimes I like to

put those little things there when I'm

when I'm feeling in a good mood I put

these things on when I'm not feeling in

a good mood I leave them out I see so in

most of the books they use lower case

yeah

but then for special cases no no okay

I'm Phi is Phi Phi is Phi and I have not

them and I did not mean to distinguish

up a case from lower case right wait

wait wait I got to put in all this to

mean I want to be consistent here what

let me swear oh okay no was there a

questions he was asking about indices

balancing oh I don't remember my stuff

wrote it by for refuge do we need an

index up index down yeah

yeah what's really meant by D no Phi

star D mu no no no no no no no no they

are the okay so let's if you have a

four-vector an arbitrary for vector V mu

you can multiply it by G mu nu a

symmetric and get V mu we know all right

the meaning of this symbol for ordinary

special relativity is that the time

components of these two are the same in

sign and the space components are

opposite all right so

right the meaning of this is it should

be taken to be the upper to the lower

the covariant vector times the earth

right but I don't want to write that

every time over and over so I just write

an abstract symbol derivative times

derivative yeah the lowering operator

there hmm

you have lower on the left upper on the

right sorry you're right thank you right

but we've already gone through special

relativity a number of times and so I

don't feel the need to to be so careful

about relativity indices all right so I

won't even I won't even bother writing

them for the most part I'm not going to

write them I keep writing them okay

ah good now here I if i plug in D mu Phi

Prime I will get this unwanted nasty

piece over here but if I also plug in a

prime times Phi where is a prime let me

write a prime over here a prime equals a

see the plus or minus D mu theta then

they will cancel they will cancel there

will be a term D I D nu theta times Phi

you know what I mean right so if I the

to D mu Thetas will cancel each other

one from calculating a derivative here

and the other from the explicit

difference between a prime and AE so

what will I find what I'll tell you

exactly what I will find I will find

that D mu Phi Prime this one over here

is equal not quite to just D mu Phi what

are missing

each of the I theta overall eetu the I

theta so you say well I didn't get any

where's D mu of Phi Prime is not the

same as D mu Phi it's not gauge

invariant true enough but only

difference from being gauge invariant by

an outside overall factor of e to the I

theta which will disappear when you

multiply this by its conjugate notice

that in this formula here the derivative

of theta does not appear you have the

covariant derivative of Phi prime is

equal to the covariant derivative of Phi

up to this overall factor of e to the I

theta which will cancel when you

multiply this by D mu of Phi star prime

that will be equal to e to the minus I

theta times D mu of Phi star so when you

multiply these two together the unwanted

unpleasant things that have derivatives

of theta in them disappear what is the

cost the cost is you had to introduce a

new field which transformed in this way

which in this way over here

but once you allow yourself that freedom

to introduce a new field the vector

potential then this Lagrangian over here

becomes invariant than the gauge

transformations later on we'll write it

out in some more detail but one more

point before we jump to the conclusion

and that's the electromagnetic part of

the Lagrangian this field is a charge

carrying field it's not the electron

because the electron is not a boson but

it could be some charged boson of some

sort okay

some charged boson of some sort

and there are charge bosons a helium

atom is a helium nucleus as a charge

boson so if I represent some charge

boson a represents the vector potential

and the electromagnetic field is also

governed by a Lagrangian the Lagrangian

is defined f nu nu equals D nu a mu

minus D nu a mu the space-time the mixed

space-time component is the electric

field the space space component are the

magnetic fields and the square of F now

that there are some signs that go into

it f mu nu F mu nu that's a squared

minus B squared that's the lagrangian

area of the electromagnetic field the

important thing for us is that this is

gauge invariant this does not change

when you make a gauge transformation

what happens to a a changes by the

gradient of theta so what happens to

this F prime becomes f plus the nu D nu

theta minus the nu nu theta these two

terms cancel so f is itself gauge

invariant and when you add F squared

it's still gauge invariant so the whole

upshot is oh one more thing one more

thing you can add that's gauge invariant

and that's a potential which depends

only on Phi star Phi II a potential

which depends only on Phi star Phi so

the full Lagrangian of a simple gauge

Theory involving the interaction of

electromagnetism with a charged scalar

field would look like this

it would have D mu Phi D mu let's just

for D Phi D Phi star it would have

viii of five star Phi which is just V of

Rho if you remember and then plus F

squared plus a squared minus B squared

and it would be fully gauge invariant no

change in it when you make a CH

transformation that's the simplest gauge

theory in a nutshell that's basically it

that's basically the structure of all

gauge theories they have a structure

similar to this now let's ask how what

happens when the symmetry of rotation of

Phi is spontaneously broken when does

that happen it happens when the

potential has this upside-down sombrero

I guess it's not an upside-down sombrero

when it has that shape so that the

ground state of Phi breaks the symmetry

what happens what new thing happens or

what new thing happens oh before we do

that let's let's just remember that the

this potential is such that the angular

Direction is a Goldstone boson no mass

the radial direction which we call the

Higgs boson has a mass and furthermore

the photon does not have a mass how do I

know the photon doesn't have a mass the

reason is simple the F is only a

function of the derivatives of the

vector potential that means if you were

to shift the vector potential everywhere

simultaneously there would be no change

in energy okay

shift the pretend the vector potential

everywhere is together no change in

energy that means a massless particle so

there are two massless two apparent

massless particles floating around in

this theory one is the Goldstone boson

and the other is the is the photon

and now watch what happens let's take a

what way what would a mass term for the

photon look like if you had one well the

mass term is always something which is

quadratic in the field for example the

mass of Phi if it existed would be Phi

star Phi star Phi or Phi squared 5 5 X

Phi real squared plus Phi imaginary

squared or the photon mass B it would be

something proportional to a squared to

the vector potential squared if you

allowed yourself to put the vector

potential squared into the Lagrangian

you would have a mass for the photon

that would not be gauge invariant look

at it

here's a squared which means this means

a mu a mu if you put that into the

Lagrangian what would happen when you

make a gauge transformation it would

shift to a plus the gradient of theta

squared all right

but that's not the same as a squared a

squared is not the same as a plus

derivative of theta squared so a squared

just a squared a squared would not be

gauge invariant would not be gauge

invariant so a mass term is not allowed

by gauge invariance gauge invariance is

a symmetry which prohibits the photon

from having a mass or does it well let's

look at this little engine a little more

closely and in particular let's look at

this term over here

in fact let's concentrate on the

Goldstone boson piece of it and we can

do that by writing that Phi is f times e

to the I at now let's not let's not

let's just let's go for it here's the

here's the terminal again G all right so

what's in here D Phi is derivative of

Phi plus there's a plus I a times Phi is

that right hmm that's what I wrote d Phi

star is derivative of Phi minus I a five

star all right now let's suppose that

we're looking at the ground state when

the field is right over here when Phi is

equal to F let's say just the real value

the real value of Phi is equal to F

let's for simplicity let's say the

imaginary part of Phi is zero so the

field is sitting right over here let's

look at the various terms first of all

ah well the most important term is this

one here a times five times five star

but five times five star is stuck at the

minimum here

it's stuck at the minimum because it

takes a lot of energy to shift Phi away

from the minimum so as long as we don't

excite a lot of energy is an effective

term in the Lagrangian which is just a

squared times Phi star Phi which is just

equal to F squared times a squared right

somebody said yeah why'd you say from

because you immediately see that this is

behaving like a mass term for the photon

this is behaving exactly like a mass

term for the photon what's the mass the

mass is basically just F actually twice

f well square root of two times F but

this factor this numerical factor here

is playing the role forget this that's

playing the role of a squared times s

squared which would be a mass for the

photon it would be an energy that you

get when you shift the field homogeneous

li okay so what have we learned we've

learned that when you spontaneously

break the symmetry when you study the

theory in the neighborhood of the

minimum over here the effect of one of

the terms in the Lagrangian is just to

make a mass for the photon isn't that

interesting when the photon propagates

in this world where the symmetry is

spontaneously broken it behaves as if it

had a mass and it does have a mass for

all practical purposes so we've gotten

around the statement that says photons

can't have mass now real photons of

course don't have mass but this photons

in this world where the spontaneously

broken symmetry do have mass the second

thing is the Goldstone boson disappears

why does the Goldstone boson disappear

well let's remember what the Goldstone

boson is is this angle alpha the angle

of the field on the complex plane what

does a gauge transformation of all what

is the Goldstone boson the Goldstone

boson is simply a slowly varying or a

varying value of alpha alpha is a field

it can vary in space if it couldn't vary

in space it wouldn't be interesting

alpha can vary in space but you can make

alpha vary another way you can make it

vary by doing a gauge transformation

adding a little bit of theta of X so you

can make alpha vary from place to place

and you

think that that Lake so Goldstone boson

but it doesn't because this is a

symmetry a symmetry means that you don't

change the energy it means that the

system stays in the ground state this is

not a real change it's a gauge

transformation so the Goldstone boson

completely disappears it completely

disappears it just becomes a gauge

transformation no real energy associated

with it and at the same time the vector

potential gains a mass so it's a sort of

zero-sum game you get rid of one man

where you fill another zero-sum game

you've removed the massless Goldstone

boson and we move the massless photon

replacing the massless photon by a

massive photon and at the same time the

Higgs boson now has a mass because it

oscillates about here that's the that's

the big phenomenon it by plugging in

basically just by plugging in the value

of the higgs field or the value of Phi

at the minimum here we generated a mass

term for the photon and where did it

come from it came from this covariant

derivative so it just came from the

covariant derivative ah

could you rewrite your whole leg ranging

in size could you rewrite the whole

librarian in those terms yes you can

and you know yes you can you can rewrite

the Lagrangian in those terms you can do

a gauge transformation and basically

completely remove this angular degree of

freedom completely remove the angle from

the I'll show you a little simple baby

version of that if you completely forgot

the radial degree of freedom alt enough

this completely froze it just completely

froze it you would find that the

Lagrangian let's see yeah the covariant

derivative of Phi would become F I think

times the derivative of alpha plus the

vector potential itself maybe times e to

the R

let's see Phi is just equal to F times e

to the I alpha and so the derivative of

Phi is f I alpha sorry fifa15 to the I

alpha so there would be an e to the I

alpha multiplying the whole thing this

is just setting the magnitude or the row

equal to F okay I think F would come on

the outside here wouldn't it if we come

on the outside this would be the

covariant derivative of Phi and it would

contain the derivative of the angular

part that's the important thing it

contains the derivative the angular part

all right what about the derivative of

Phi star that would be the same thing

derivative of alpha I here - I a times e

to the minus I alpha F I'm getting tired

so it's getting

getting a little bit late that's that's

what you would get okay when you

multiply them together you would get

exactly what you expect okay now you

also have F mu nu you have this times

this in the Lagrangian and you have F mu

nu squared now let's make a gauge

transformation this is a clever gauge

transformation which is designed to get

rid of this term all together how can

you make a gauge transformation that

gets rid of this term just set theta

equal to minus alpha remember what

happens to the vector potential when you

make a gauge transformation it just

picks up a derivative theta if you make

your gauge transformation using for the

gauge function theta alpha itself this

just goes away completely or sorry it

doesn't go away completely it just

becomes a and this terminal Lagrangian

just becomes a squared so by design you

can construct the gauge transformation

which just removes this this times this

gets rid of the alpha dependence

altogether and you just get F squared

times a squared all you get is the mass

term that's all that's left and of

course you still have F squared but this

is gauge invariance so it doesn't change

when you do the gauge transformation net

result are the angular degree of freedom

just sort of disappears some magic

happen the angular degree of freedom

disappeared the Goldstone boson is gone

and the photon has a mass meanwhile the

Higgs boson which is this radial

oscillation that's still there so this

is the magic of the Higgs phenomena and

it's the phenomenon of giving a mass to

the gauge bosons by spontaneous emission

is it fair to say that the the

oscillations in alpha are

indistinguishable from just gauge

oscillations problem yes from this

station yes that's fair to say it's not

only fair to say it's true now I will

tell you right now that this is also the

physics of superconductors in a

superconductor

there are charged bosons the charged

bosons are bound pairs of electrons

they're called Cooper pairs Cooper pairs

are bound are loosely bound pairs of

electrons but they are bosons so there's

a charged boson field in the system and

the charged boson field gets shifted

away from the origin by some complicated

dynamics in the superconductor it

creates a condensate of those charged

pairs and it's equivalent to exactly

this kind of spontaneous symmetry

breaking where Phi would be replaced by

the field describing the Cooper pairs so

this is also the physics of a

superconductor and in the superconductor

the photon also behaves like a like a

massive particle one last thing how can

you lose a degree of freedom how on

earth can a degree of freedom disappear

the angular dissipative degree of

freedom it didn't disagree at they

disappear what has happened a massless

photon has two polarization States

remember polarization is a little arrow

that there is perpendicular to the

motion of the photon it's if you like

the light of the direction of the

electric field oscillations so every

photon carries with it a a polarization

vector there are two orthogonal

directions for the polarizer if the

photon is going that way the

polarization can be that way or can be

that way so there are two polarization

States you can also think of them as the

states of circular polarization of the

photon there is no state in which the

polarization vector of the photon points

along the direction of motion Maxwell

theory doesn't allow that why is that

assistant if a photon is described as a

vector how can it be that it only has

two components and not a third and the

answer is very simple

the photon moves of the speed of light

it can never be brought to rest suppose

it could be brought to rest supposing

the photon could be brought to rest if

it could be brought to rest and you

brought it to rest it was going down

that way and you brought it to rest that

had a I've had a polarization along the

x-axis and you brought it to rest it

would be a particle at rest with a

polarization along the x-axis

now you could accelerate it along the

x-axis and all of a sudden it would

become a particle whose polarization was

along its direction of motion so the

answer is a if a particle like the

photon were to have mass it would have

to have three directions of polarization

it could have you could bring it to rest

and once it's at rest there's no

distinction between the three directions

it would have to have three directions

of polarization and then if you sped it

up along some axis it would have three

directions of polarization the massless

particle can never be brought to rest

and it's perfectly consistent for it to

only have two directions of polarization

namely circular this way or circular

this way another way of thinking about

it is if you take a particle circularly

right-handed polarized and you brought

it to rest and then accelerate it off in

the opposite direction it would all of a

sudden have left handed polarized it

would have left hand left hand so it's

also a way to think about it the point

is that you have not lost the degree of

freedom the Goldstone boson has really

become the other missing polarization of

the photon or another way of saying it

is you started with three degree or four

degrees of freedom the to come the two

component for each each focus the two

components of the charged scalar and the

two components of polarization of the

photon in the end you were left again

with four degrees of freedom

three polarizations of the photon and

the Higgs boson so you really haven't

lost any degrees of freedom you've

you've turned the Goldstone boson into

the what's called the longitudinal

degree of freedom of the photon the one

in which the vector potential or a field

is pointing the vert the electric field

is pointing along the direction of

motion that's what's happening but they

all have mass now the next time I will

show you the physics in a simplified

context the same context of why the

fermions the electrons and the and the

quarks get their mass from the Higgs

phenomenon so far we haven't talked

about the quarks and the electrons they

also have mass what does the matter what

does their mass have to do with the

Higgs phenomenon that will be the next

time when we finish that we will have a

setup in which all particles including

the Higgs boson all get their mass from

the same place namely the spontaneous

symmetry breaking then we can start to

talk about this very interesting

situation that all of the particles in

nature that we know you know that we've

measured are the ones which would become

massless if there was no spontaneous

symmetry breaking boy that I've had

enough for the night
