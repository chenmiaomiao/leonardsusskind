Stanford University I'll go over it

again very quickly and and then and then

tell you what the Higgs phenomenon has

to do with masses of quarks and leptons

so far I've explained to you how the

gauge bosons not the photon but the Z

and the W boson how they obtain masses

from this shift of the field away from

the most symmetric position which field

the Higgs field but though that's all I

went through it in a very simple context

where I made it look very much like

ordinary electrodynamics and I'll

continue to do that but keep in mind

we're not talking about the photon we're

talking about other gauge particles so

let's just go back to electrodynamics

which we're not really talking about but

still the mathematics is the same there

are these gauge bosons the analogs of

photons the mathematics of them may be a

little more complicated the symmetry

group may not be u1 it may be su 2 or su

3 but now that's not terribly important

and there is a dynamics that leads to

Maxwell's equations it's governed in

fact does the simplest way to

encapsulate it is in terms of a

Lagrangian you begin with a good pen

you begin with the field tensor let me

just remind you what it is it's in terms

of the vector potential you begin with

that you square it let's just call it f

squared you make the appropriate the

Lorentz invariant combination of squares

of components of electric and magnetic

field and that's the Lagrangian and

notice it only contains derivatives of a

and therefore the photon is massless to

have a mass you have to have you have to

get an energy a mass corresponds to an

energy corresponding to shifting a field

homogeneous li everywhere as with no

derivatives this has no energy or no no

energy associated with a uniform shift

of the vector potential because only the

derivatives come in and so the photon by

virtue of this is massless at most of

the speed of light and this simply leads

to Maxwell's equations now you add

something else you add this Higgs field

the Higgs field is a field which

corresponds to charged particles again I

emphasize when not talking about

ordinary electric charge we're talking

about the charges that couple to the Z

and W bosons the weak charges and we

write this Phi in the form Rho e to the

I alpha it's a complex valued field Rho

times e to the I alpha and we write down

its Lagrangian we write its Lagrangian

in terms of these things that I called

covariant derivatives D Phi is equal to

the derivative of Phi plus or I can't

remember if it's plus or minus I times

the vector potential times Phi we write

the Lagrangian in terms of those things

and all of a sudden we have an

interesting interaction

between the electromagnetic field and

the charge field here's the here's the

source of the interaction right over

here that would be basically that would

be electrodynamics ordinary

electrodynamics but now something new

happens the something new hat that

happens is the energetics the potential

energy of fie favor something unusual

namely that Phi is the minimum value of

Phi sorry the minimum value of the

potential energy is not at Phi equals

zero but at the bottom of this Mexican

hat potential somewheres an arbitrary

position along there and so we write

that Phi let's say the radius of this

circle here is f the magnitude of the

field the magnitude of this let's call

it by its name the magnitude of this

Higgs field is now F is shifted away

from the origin by amount F and it is

also true that the that the curvature at

the bottom here is very steep and so it

cost a lot of energy to shift the field

away from the bottom here and some first

approximation we can just say that Phi

is simply equal to F the numerical

number times e to the I alpha of X only

alpha is allowed to vary and F is sort

of frozen frozen because it takes too

much energy to shift it away from the

minimum but alpha the angular variable

is still there all right we could write

let me tell you what happens now we

could take our this form for Phi and

figure out what the covariant derivative

of Phi is given the Phi has this frozen

form where only alpha varies I'll write

it for you it's just equal to the

derivative of alpha

plus I a now all of that gets multiplied

by F times e to the I alpha

that's the covariant derivative of Phi

the derivative of alpha sorry I think

it's I don't know no I here Plus this

and maybe there's an overall yes I think

there's an overall I that's what you get

when you calculate the covariant

derivative now next thing we're going to

do is multiply this by its complex

conjugate to compute the action or the

Lagrangian for for what fourth no F is

just a number we've already assumed that

F can vary very much the Lagrangian for

alpha let's see what we get we're going

to get F squared the number F squared

that's a number and then we're going to

get derivative of alpha it's the

derivative of alpha with respect to

space or time plus the vector potential

squared and e to the I alpha is going to

cancel because we're multiplying it by

its complex conjugate this is what you

get for the Lagrangian of the higgs

field if you make the approximation that

it's stuck where is it that it's stuck

and can't move away from the minimum I

may if I may have blown the sign but

that I a blow the sign I don't think so

whether no there was also an I in this

term because when you differentiate fire

you'll get I times the derivative of

alpha

alright so both of them have an I and I

stuck it out over here

oh oh oh oh yeah there are a lot of

let's see yeah I times minus I is one

yeah I times minus I'd you scared me for

a minute but that is that I squared its

items - I well the complex conjugate it

involves - I okay so what do we get we

get this expression over here now do you

remember what a gauge transformation

looks like gauge transformation which is

a symmetry which is supposed to do

nothing to the physics take any function

let's call it theta which is what I call

the last time but it could be anything

it could be anything a gauge

transformation is to take a and shift it

by the derivative of theta that's a

gauge transformation but look at this

this is a plus the derivative of

something this is a gauge transformation

this is a gauge transformation where

what we have used for the gauge

transformation is not an arbitrary

function theta but this alpha field this

alpha field itself now look what we have

let's redefine a plus the derivative of

alpha it's just a J gauge transformation

of AE let's redefine it let's give it a

new name let's call it a prime okay

let's call it a prime this is f squared

times a prime squared that's all this is

what happens to F squared which

originally involved a what happens to F

if we replace a by a prime it's

completely unchanged because F is gauge

invariant and so we can also think of F

squared or F as this thing over here

doesn't make any difference

and what do we find that the net upshot

the net upshot of it all is to just

replace the original variables by prime

variables and that's just renaming

that's just a new name for something and

to add a term in the Lagrangian which is

proportional to the square of the vector

potential that was the net effect just

add a term for the Lagrangian for the

gauge field which is proportional to a

squared no derivatives in it the no

derivatives in this term here it's just

a prime squared that means that if you

were to shift a prime Everywhere's

simultaneously you would get some energy

from this term this term is a mass for

the photon it's not the photon of course

it's the Z and the W boson so here's an

example of how this shift of the field

from zero the value F gives a mass to a

particle which you might have said is

not allowed to have a mass how that

happened the vacuum shifted to some new

spontaneously broken vacuum and the

excitations of the electromagnetic field

in that shifted vacuum have a mass okay

so that's the Higgs phenomena and

furthermore the Alpha field is gone

that's gone it's been absorbed into this

thing we call de Prime

so there's no massless particle anymore

the Goldstone boson has disappeared it

has made a mass for the gauge boson and

that's it now not quite it there is

still this thing that we froze in an

approximation and the approximation we

said let's ignore the oscillations of

the field back and forth in this other

direction if we give in the system

enough energy if we really poked it hard

enough we can start this Higgs field

oscillating in the radial direction

let's go

the radial Direction is not a radial

direction in space it's this radial

direction and field space those

oscillations also are quanta and their

massive quantify they have a lot of

energy even at rest they oscillate back

and forth and those are the Higgs bosons

those are the Higgs bosons so we started

with massless photons massless Goldstone

bosons and massive Higgs bosons and we

ended up with massive Higgs bosons no

Goldstone boson and a massive photon

that's the Higgs phenomenon could you

say again why the a prime squared

indicates the also yeah whenever you

have a what first of all what is a mass

a mass is an energy from a field theory

point of view massive cost is inertia of

a particle or whatever but from a field

theory well it'll go back a step a mass

and special relativity is just the

energy of a system at rest if a system

has no momentum if it's at rest in its

own reference frame then it's the energy

in that reference frame ism is the mass

so that's the first step

energy at rest is called mass now what

is being at rest mean being at rest

means having no momentum from a field

theory point of view from the point of

view of fields or from the point of view

of quantum mechanics a particle at rest

or a particle with zero momentum

corresponds to the quantum of a field of

infinite wavelength infinite wavelength

means the field doesn't vary at all from

point to point and so a mass what it

corresponds to is an energy stored in a

field if you shift the fields

simultaneously Everywhere's

with no derivative no spatial derivative

just shift the field everywhere

simultaneously if you get some energy

that energy is called the mass okay well

we started with a Lagrangian and also an

expression for energy which only

involves derivatives of a field if it

only involves derivatives of field that

means that if we shift the field

everywhere simultaneously we won't get

any energy so in that sense if this was

all that there was for the photon then

we would say the photon has no mass a

uniform shift of the vector potential

would not create any energy we say the

photon has no mass but now once there's

a term in here like this which doesn't

involve derivatives does not involve the

derivatives of a that means if we shift

a simultaneously everywhere the response

the energy stored in this term is not

zero we shifted a from zero where the

energy was zero to something else we've

got some energy that that energy is

called the mass of the photon so it's

energy stored you know does everybody

know what I mean by homogeneous

homogeneous means everywhere is the same

all right if you shift the photon field

everywhere is the same and you get any

energy from it that's the mass of the

photon in fact in particle physics are

in field theory in general if you

identify the mass of a particle as an

energy stored in shifting the field

simultaneously everywhere it's not just

in particle physics in all kinds of

contexts I think I talked about them

last time but let me just remember it

remind you again ah a sound wave in a

crystal a sound wave in a crystal

corresponds the motion of the crystal

lattice which you could think of as the

response to a shift of the position of

the molecules if you shift the position

of the molecules in a variable way

in other words way down here you shift

them to the left to centimeter and then

half way down then you shift them to the

left a half a centimeter and then over

here you don't shift them at all and

then over here

a half a centimeter to the right and so

forth you make a long wavelength um it's

called a phonon a long wavelength phonon

but it's a kind of wave in the crystal

way we're very slowly varying and this

energy stored in that you've deformed

the crystal a little bit that energy is

called the energy of a phonon now what

happens if you shift the crystal

Everywhere's simultaneously by exactly

the same amount we could call that a

homogeneous shift do we get any energy

from that no so a homogeneous shift

where everything is shifted

simultaneously all together that gives

no energy and so you would say phonons

are massless phonons have no mass which

means that a phonon with zero momentum

has no energy photons photons spin ons

spin ons or are in magnets they have to

do with the orientation of the little

fundamental magnets if you reorient the

magnets and a variable way from place to

place you get a little bit of energy

it's called a spin wave if you rotate

all the magnets together simultaneously

everywhere it costs no energy you just

rotated the magnet so that's another

example of waves which at infinite

wavelength or homogeneous waves have no

energy

there were also massless I thought we

started out this analysis with a

particle it was vibrating a little bit

in alpha yeah

and really helped and that that

originally before we coupled it to a to

the vector potential its energy was

purely Rho squared D Wow it's just let's

call it f squared D alpha squared that's

all there was it was just a square of

this thing where the vector potential

was completely absent from the problem

okay now because it only involves

derivatives if we shift alpha everywhere

Dainius Lee in other words everywhere is

in space we shift the angle instead of

saying the field has the value over here

we put it over here everywhere is in

space that costs no energy it costs no

energy because it didn't make any

derivatives I'm not sure what the

question was but does that answer it

well by shifting it you're changing Elfa

you're changing alpha and that means but

it's derivative of alpha which gives you

anything

oh because you're not continuously

moving it in alpha that's right you're

not moving you're not changing it from

place to place if you change it from

place to place that's the energy of the

Goldstone boson all right but if you

shift it everywhere simultaneously then

it costs no energy why because the

energy only involves gradients okay so

that's the idea so keep that in mind as

a buzzword that mass stands for energy

at rest our but it also stands for

energy associated with uniform

homogeneous shifts of fields fields or

whatever it is we're talking about there

is an interesting example to say to get

the to get an idea of how mass can

happen I explained to you that if you

have a crystal and you move all the

molecules simultaneously it doesn't cost

any energy now supposing your crystal

lattice was composed of particles which

themselves had both plus some plus

charges in sum minus charges okay so

these are molecules are ions plus ions

and minus ions or they it could just be

atoms they could be the protons that the

nuclei at the center and the electrons

around them and supposing you did the

following you shifted all of the

electrons to the left uniformly and all

the protons to the right uniformly that

would be called a homogeneous shift just

a little bit just a little separation

between the electron

on cloud and the nuclei do you think

that would cost any energy your bet

because you would have pull the plus

charges away from the minus charges that

would be a homogeneous shift of my

fields but locations which would cost

energy what do you think what happen if

you made that shift the the the plus

particles this way the minus particles

this way what will happen next

it'll start to vibrate okay

it will not behave the way it would if

everything was moved simultaneously so

moving everything simultaneously that's

a zero momentum phone on moving the plus

charges relative to the minus charges

what does that call anybody no a plasma

a plasma plasma Ahn's have mass phonons

do not drift include what oh yeah

absolutely

absolutely yes yes yes yes what you're

saying is right but I'm just imagining

spatially shifting everything and not

inducing any time derivatives well all

right we good no no it's a good question

no no by shifting I don't mean an actual

process I just mean the mathematical

change and what you mean by the vacuum

right well you do it extremely slowly

very very slowly move it from here to

here yes you're right these the the

actual energy contains time derivatives

also but I was simply the same is true

incidentally of the crystal lattice what

are the time derivatives of the shifts

their kinetic energy the velocities of

molecules so if you really give the

crystal a shift which means it's moving

off with a velocity then of course this

kinetic energy so when I set a shift I

meant a shift in your imagination where

you shift everything simultaneously and

started out at rest compared to where

originally was also at rest good but

that's a good point

okay let's talk now about fermions this

means electrons muons and so forth and

where they get their mass from it turns

out the real electron muon quarks also

get their mass from this Higgs

phenomenon from the spontaneous symmetry

breaking let's discuss what we know

about the first thing we go back to is

the basics of the theory of number

theory but actually experimental data

about weak interactions this could be

beta decay the decay of a neutron to a

proton but the and an electron and the

anti neutrino okay here's what goes back

to 50s the 50s no earlier than the 50s I

think I don't remember exactly what are

the following fact was discovered first

of all reflection symmetry which means

reflection of space left hand in the

right hand is not a good symmetry of

nature

it's an ancient fact from the 50s that

was discovered that the reflection the

mirror reflection of a process is not

another possible process now in quantum

electrodynamics the mirror image of any

process is another possible process that

itself is a symmetry it's not a

continuous symmetry it's a discrete

symmetry you take everything and you

reflect it you don't rotate it you

reflect it you take the left hand in the

right there's no hand which is sort of

Midway there's no continuous way to go

from left hand to right hand so

replacing every left hand by a right

hand or

left-left the screw thread with the

right screw thread and so forth that's a

symmetry of quantum electrodynamics and

it's also a symmetry of quantum

chromodynamics it is not a symmetry of

the weak interactions left and right are

fundamentally different and as different

as they can be so let me tell you what

the experimental fact is that the decay

of a neutron neutron which gives a

proton an electron and an anti-neutrino

well let's first talk about the

handedness of particles is there any

sense in which particles are handed have

a handedness like my hands yes there is

they have a spinner they also have a

direction of motion all right if the

spin is along the direction of motion in

other words there are two possibilities

the spin can be oriented along the

direction of motion or it can be

oriented opposite to the direction of

motion in quantum mechanics of course if

the spin is oriented in some other

direction you can build it up out of

super positions of the two states along

the direction of motion and opposite all

right so an electron moving along with a

high momentum for example can either

have it spin along the direction of

motion that means it's rotating with a

right hand screw thread okay it's

rotating or spinning with a right hand

screw third that's called a right-handed

electron and an electron can also be a

left-handed electron that simply means

that spin is going R is helical e going

in the opposite direction so there are

two kinds of electrons right-handed and

left-handed now um what happens in a

beta decay like this you might think you

could either make right-handed or

left-handed electrons right-handed and

left-handed electrons or as good as each

other in every respect in quantum

electrodynamics there are no processes

which are not symmetric if you can make

a right-handed electron in some process

then there's a reflected process which

is also a possible process where you can

make a left-handed electron if right as

possible left as possible nevertheless

when the process of beta decay became

something where you could really do with

precision and study the handedness of

the electrons that come out they're

always left handed there are never a

process it doesn't matter what

orientation the spin of the neutron has

no matter what you do the electrons

which come out are always left handed ah

this goes beyond the theory of beta

decay any weak interaction process in

other words any process where a W boson

for example where a W boson interacts

and takes a electron into a neutrino or

way you interchange you know where you

flip these lines to make to make

different processes out of it it's

always the left-handed electron which

interacts with the W boson never a

right-handed electron so for example you

could imagine a process where an

electron scatters off something changes

into a neutrino and there's something

over here that it scatters off a proton

or something else or another electron

you'll always find that the left-handed

electron scatters and the right-handed

electron doesn't this is this is a fact

and the same thing is true of the

neutrino incidentally it's always a

left-handed neutrino it's questionable

whether a right-handed neutrino

existance evently this is a question

which we've not answered we'll come back

to it another time but this certainly

exists both right-handed and left-handed

electrons we think they are also

probably right-handed and left-handed

neutrinos

all right so electron so this

something asymmetric left-right

asymmetric about about the weak

interactions and it is what is it it is

that the left-handed electrons are

charged with respect to the W boson in

other words we could imagine a situation

in electrodynamics which would be

similar it's an untrue situation don't

dilute it right now this is not correct

right but we could imagine a world in

which only left-handed electrons are

charged left-handed electrons could

scatter off photons or could produce

photons and become left-handed electrons

and which right-handed electrons could

not we could imagine it it's not true

you say well over and over it is not

true but imagine it then you would say

that the left-handed electron has an

electric charge and the right-handed

electron does not now that's bizarre I

mean that's that's really bizarre okay

and it's not true but with respect to

the weak interactions not the emission

of a photon but the emission of a W

boson it is as if the left-handed

particles carried charge associated with

the emission of a gauge boson and the

right-handed particles did not that's a

very strange fact it's empirical fact

what's it's also true of quarks it is

also true of quarks which we have to

going to modify the statement a little

bit but at some deep level it's exactly

true okay let's talk about left-handed

and right-handed particles fermions and

let's go back to the Dirac equation and

I will tell you a little bit about the

connection between the Dirac equation

and the handedness of particles I'm not

going to spend a lot of time I'm just

going to give you the rough outlines of

the idea

let's go back to the Dirac equation the

Dirac equation looks something like this

I sigh by DT this is the Dirac field

which could correspond to the electron

it could correspond to the muon it could

be the field for quarks they all have

the same form the Dirac equations the

are time derivative of the Dirac field

and remember what the direct field is is

it's a four component object where the

four components correspond to let's say

two different subdivisions the particles

can have spin along either axis that

gives you two components up spin and

down spin and the particles can have

positive or negative energy

remember Dirac particles can have

positive or negative energy now we've

learned over and over again that the

negative energy particles should be

replaced by anti particles or positive

energy but in the mathematics

the Dirac field has four components up

spin positive energy down spin positive

energy up spin negative energy down spin

positive energy or you can think of it

as up spinning down spin of particle and

anti particle

okay so there are four components to the

Dirac field and the components think of

it as a 4 component column vector there

are matrices 4 by 4 matrices called the

Dirac matrices Dirac call them alpha 3

alpha sorry 3 alphas one two each

direction of space let's call them alpha

I for the three directions of space

times the derivative of the field with

respect to X sub I

this would be the Dirac equation if the

particle had no mass now how can you see

that you can see that because the

equation only involves derivatives of

the field if the field the whole

dynamics of the field only involves

derivatives of the field we've seen in

previous situations that when the

dynamics of the field only involves

derivatives the field is massless

there's no restoring force no tendency

for the field to oscillate and unless it

has a gradient no time derivative unless

there's a space derivative so if you

shift the field psy everywhere

simultaneously it does not create an

oscillation does not create in the

energy what do you put on the right-hand

side if you want to have a mass for the

field well there was a fourth Dirac

matrix called beta we put the mass times

beta times

psy that's the Dirac equation now the

electron could be moving along with a

momentum a momentum means as a gradient

of the field psy it means a plane wave

but that's not so important and the spin

can either be along the direction of

motion or opposite to the direction of

motion those two components we can think

of that as the left-handed components of

the Dirac field and the right-handed

components so let me write these

equations for you this is four equations

one for each component let's write them

for the left and right-handed components

separately here's what it looks like I

times the derivative of the right-handed

component of the Dirac field describing

right-handed electrons plus I alpha I

derivative of the right-handed field is

equal

now you might think that the right thing

to put here is something involving the

right-handed field but it turns out this

bait this matrix beta interchanges right

hand and left hand so a mass term over

here corresponds to a coupling between

right-handed and left-handed and

likewise is the equation for the

left-handed component dasai left-handed

by DT turns out it's minus I alpha sub I

Desai left-handed by DXi is equal to M

Tsai right-handed in other words it's a

funny equation in which the right-handed

and left-handed components are

completely independent if the mass is

zero but the mass mixes them up roughly

speaking you can think of a Dirac

electron as one which as it moves along

oscillates between left and right the

oscillation is the mass term but let's

let's not push that too hard it's not

quite right the mass term couples

together the left-handed and

right-handed components this is for a

Dirac particle what a mass term is it's

a thing which couples together it's a

it's a man it's an energy which is only

the air of both the left-handed and the

right-handed components are both excited

okay now we can see what the some odd

things let's suppose that only the

left-handed Dirac particle had a charge

which is true with respect to the weak

interactions not true with respect to

the electromagnetic but let's just

pretend only the left-handed electron

has a charge the right-handed electron

has no charge okay

a fictitious world is this equation

allowable then well it's not because the

meaning of this equation is that a

right-handed particle moving along will

turn into a left-handed particle I'll

explain it another way in a second and a

left-handed particle moving along will

turn into a right-handed particle what

does this mean it means that charge

conservation would be violated I left a

right-handed field becoming a

left-handed field would violate charge

conservation another way to say it is to

remember that a charged field if a field

has charged it gets multiplied under a

gauge transformation or under one of

these u1 transformations it gets

multiplied by e to the I theta if it has

no charge it does not get better or

multiplied by e to the I theta now we

look at this equation this equation if

the right-handed field is neutral has no

charge

then under au one transformation nothing

would happen to the left hand side but

the right hand side would pick up a

factor of e to the I theta likewise over

here the left hand side would pick up a

factor of e to the I theta the right

hand side would not these equations

cannot be symmetric if only Tsai left is

multiplied by e to the I theta and not

Tsai right that's another way of saying

that charge conservation would not

permit a mixing of left and right like

this if if only the left handed electron

were charged both of them are charged in

reality because both of them carry the

same charge you can go back and forth

from left to right without violating

charge conservation yeah probably not no

they're probably not oh no no no I'm

into this sorry no you're right they're

not consistent there I pull the whole I

out on the outside you're right okay

yeah okay so it's just basic charge

conservation would forbid the

possibility of a mass for the electron

if only left-handed electrons had

charged or if only right-handed

electrons had charged fortunately for

the real world that's not true electrons

both right-handed electron and

left-handed charge the electron has a

mass the world would be very different

that the electron didn't have a mass and

chemistry wouldn't exist yeah then we

wouldn't be in a happy world how would

the world be different if right-handed

electrons could be even in from weak

interaction

at both right-handed and left-handed

we'll come to it

we'll come to it that would be very

different but um but we will come to it

okay so let's come to the weekend right

yeah question it you can you can measure

the spin of electrons vertically unless

they select the ones that are pointing

upward and if you accelerate those in

that direction do you say they have a

spin it's the type that you're talking

with the same thing okay there's an

interesting question is it possible that

there would only be one kind of electron

namely only left-handed electrons yes it

is but only if a massless so I don't let

me explain why supposing there was only

a left-handed electron that means it

spins only to the left when it moves you

know it has a left-handed helical kind

of motion all right now if the electron

has a mass you could imagine slowing it

down and bringing it to rest bringing it

to rest in a way that doesn't change its

angular momentum you can bring you could

exert a force on it which doesn't change

its angular momentum so in that case you

would take this electron which is moving

along rotating to the left with a

left-handed motion bring it to rest and

even go past that bring it back the

other way its rotation sense of rotation

hasn't changed

that's just angular momentum

conservation but its direction of

velocity has changed it has turned into

a right-handed electron if I judge by my

thumb if it's moving in that direction

then the direction my fingers is its

handedness right so if it's rotating

that way and moving that way its

left-handed but if it's rotating that

way and moving that way it's

right-handed so if the particle has a

mass you can always bring it to rest and

over decelerate it and send it

from the opposite direction and you're

guaranteed then that you've taken a left

handed electron and turned it into

right-handed okay if it has a mass what

if it has no mass then you simply can't

bring it to rest

you simply cannot do this process of

taking it the moving in that direction

slowing it down bring it to rest what

you can do is rotate it around but that

does not change I don't change my left

hand to my right hand when I rotate

around but if I can bring it to rest

then you can be sure that both kinds

have if I can bring it to rest that can

be sure that both kinds necessarily have

to exist you can only bring an object to

rest if it has a mass so there's another

way of thinking about yeah a circularly

polarized photon okay it changes it to

polarization if it's rotating that way

it bounces off the mirror it will

continue to wrote that way but it will

go in the opposite direction that means

it's changed from circular polarization

right handed circular polarization

left-handed so the photon is also well

that's right it never came to rest right

right okay if the if you had a particle

which only could have one eliciting

félicité means this handedness then you

couldn't have a mirror that reflected it

generally about but because okay because

real electrons have a mass it means the

electron the real electron is a mixture

so that doesn't make it hard to focus

focusing I'd like to do with the

straightness to get position

your left hand on the right hand and it

could happen depends it depends on what

exactly was focusing and now to a good

approximation left-handed and

right-handed particles in an electric or

magnetic field behave the same way they

have the same trajectories not quite

because of the difference of the

magnetic moment right so magnetic

moments are small of an electron and a

length of an electric field or a

gradient of a magnetic field well a

magnetic field in general I think what

you're saying is a magnetic field will

affect the left-handed in the

right-handed electrons differently yeah

this is true yeah it gives me that's

right

Melo's but 10 happen ok so how so here

we are in a world of what is that just

an accident of nature probably not an

accident of nature it's it's not an

accident of nature but for the moment

let's treat it as an accident of nature

an empirical fact that we know for the

moment ok all right if it's true that

the mathematical Dirac equation if the

left-handed particle and the

right-handed particle have different

charge then the Dirac equation or the

symmetry of the system will not allow us

to mix right-handed and left-handed like

that then the question is how might the

electron get a charge they'll get a mass

excuse me how might it get a mass in

this fake world in which left-handed and

right-handed electrons have different

electric charge I'll use electric charge

just because it's familiar and I want to

make this but it's really the weak

interaction forces that were interested

in alright let's imagine that there's

another field let's make it a boson

field a boson field Phi and this boson

field Phi is also charged let's say it

has plus charge boson field means it's

quanta have positive charge let's write

down the rules of transformation under

these u1 symmetries first of all let's

write them over here I'm going to you on

transformation sign left goes to e to

the I theta psy left why because the

left-handed electrons are charged what

happens to sy right

somebody yell out it just goes to sigh

right it doesn't transform at all now

what happens to Phi it's charged right

it's charged by assumption depending on

the sign of the charge let's say it goes

the same way as this one e to the I

theta phi

okay now let's come back to the Dirac

equation over here clearly the equation

as it stands is not invariant under this

operation the left-hand side of the top

equation does not transform the

right-hand side does transform same

thing with the lower equation except

opposite but now let's play a trick

let's take this mass throw the mass out

for the moment and put in here an orbit

a constant some unknown constant which

we'll fix later the numerical constant

times Phi let's say left-handed one

transforms times a Phi star and this one

times Phi is this legal now this one

doesn't transform it all right what

about this so I left gets a phase but

Phi gets a five star gets the opposite

phase so we haven't violated the

symmetry the u 1 symmetry how about this

one no what no it's good to know it's

bad no it is good let's see sigh right

does not transform at all and I think

psy left and Phi transform the same way

right so Phi right doesn't transform at

all

sine left picks up the factor of e to

the I theta but so does

I so both of these equations are now

consistent with the symmetry this is a

perfectly good alteration of the Dirac

equation which does not violate charge

conservation that is another way to

think about it you can think about this

picture is saying a right-handed the

left hand side represents the

propagation of a right-handed particle

and the right hand side represents the

splitting into a left-handed particle

and I guess it's a five particle fire

officer an anti five particle so a

neutral particle breaks up into a

left-handed particle which has charged

and a right-handed particle which has

the opposite charge that's what this

equation means particle propagating

along makes a transition to two

particles one is left-handed and one is

of a Phi star type conserves charge and

let's say you can say the same about

this one over here a left-handed

particle moves along and becomes a Phi

and a right-handed particle that also

conserves charge so that's the way you

can think about this it just describes a

new kind of process in which left's and

rights can turn into each other but only

at the cost of emitting charged

particles to compensate the charge

what's the probability for emitting such

a particle what's the strength of this

interaction it's this constant G the G

is called a coupling constant it's not

the electromagnetic charge it's none of

it it's none of the coupling constants

we were we've already described

it's called au Cour coupling all right

now let's come back to Phi let's suppose

Phi is one of these magical Higgs fields

supposing Phi is one of these magical

Higgs fields remember the Higgs field or

there is also a charge carrying field

and let's suppose it has the form Rho e

to the I alpha

in addition something which is

definitely not true of electrodynamics

let's suppose this five field has a

spontaneous it gives rise to a

spontaneous symmetry breaking so that in

fact it has magnitude F let's forget

alpha for the moment remember alpha what

happened to alpha they got eaten by the

Higgs phenomena and disappeared out of

the system but role itself or thigh was

just proportional to this F quantity

what was F F was just the shift of the

field away from the origin then what

happens over here right Phi is too rigid

to get excited very easily and so it's

just approximated by a constant this

just becomes approximately G f sigh left

this becomes approximately G F so I

write G is just a number so is F well

okay here's how we separate them we go

back remember what happened to the

photon in this fake world it got a mass

equal to F so we look at the photon and

we say the photon not the real for time

I really mean the Z and the W we look at

the Z and the W and that tells us what F

is then we look at the fermions and we

see what G is all right but what is this

combination this combination is playing

exactly the same role as the original

mass in the Dirac equation so another

magical example of how a shift in the

Higgs field gives rise to masses for

particles the masses for particles

simply mean meaning the coupling between

left and right-handed left goes to

right-handed we identify that as the

have a fermion and here we see that it

can happen but only if the symmetry is

spontaneously broken okay so the Higgs

phenomena has another role it gives the

fermions VAS how big is the mass of the

fermions the mass of a fermion is equal

to some G times F now there are

different fermions in our world is the

electron is the muon there are the

various quarks that only means that

there are a collection of different G's

in the world

these G's are called you color couplings

and there's one for each kind of firm

yarn is an electron you call a coupling

let's estimate how big is the electron

you call a coupling remember that the

mass of the Z boson of the W boson is

essentially F anybody know what the mass

of a W boson is it's about 900 GeV right

well would somebody say how much that's

I'm sorry 90 GeV not 900 thank you 90 G

roughly a hundred GeV what's the mass of

an electron so we could be talking about

electrons here this would be the Yukawa

coupling for the electron half an MeV

right so G electron here must be a very

small number what is it it's uh it's the

ratio of the electron mass to the Z mass

and that's a hundred GeV versus half an

MeV that's a thousand a big number

hundreds of thousand how many how much

200 watt that's a hundred GeV versus a

half an MeV okay

the difference between an MeV and the

GeV is a factor of a thousand so it's

roughly a factor of 10 - this number is

about ten to the minus five very very

small number how do we know it we know

it from

knowing both the mass of the W boson and

the mass of the electron next what's the

next one the next one is the muon or the

cup cork or the down quark and there's a

variety of different numbers what's the

heaviest of the quarks the top quark and

what is that how much matter what's its

mass it's about a factor of one and a

half or two times somewhere between one

and a half and two times times the mass

of the W so that means for the top quark

this number here is a number of order

one so there's a whole spectrum of these

different you kaua couplings that nobody

understands but one thing that's

interesting is you and you say so okay

so all you've done is fit a collection

of numbers to the masses of the fermions

but now you can hope for an experimental

conserve a spare mental confirmation of

these numbers let's go back through the

coupling of the right-handed and the

left-handed particles here and remember

that F was simply the frozen value of

the Higgs field but the Higgs field is

not really frozen it really can shift

around what does the Higgs field the

Higgs field is the fluctuation away from

this frozen value the real Higgs

particle

the real Higgs particle is the

fluctuation away from here so in fact

what we should really write if we're

doing it correctly

is write F Plus the Higgs field times I

left what is this telling us this is

telling us that sorry this right this is

right I think no left yeah left this is

telling us that a process can happen

where a right handed fermion can turn

into a left-handed fermion and a Higgs

particle a real process

left right-handed particle can become a

left-handed particle and a Higgs

particle and what's the amplitude for

that the same you cower coupling you

cower you cower was a Japanese physicist

sorry you color you Oh Nicolo is a

Japanese physicist in the 40s who among

other things wrote down the mathematics

of the couplings between fermions and

bosons like this right won the Nobel

Prize for this 1940s for different

physics for nuclear physics applications

of these ideas but in any case point is

that the same coupling constant which

appears in the mass of the fermions also

governs the process of a Fermi on

becoming a Higgs boson and another Fermi

on I should draw these as solid lines

Fermi on left-handed becomes firmly on

right-handed and a Higgs boson

now we've not detected the Higgs bosons

yet we've not detected early yet so it

becomes a very very important thing once

the Higgs boson is detected to study the

different processes in which Higgs

bosons are produced to see that the

relative probabilities of producing a

Higgs boson by an electron and by a top

quark or another kind of quark that they

have the same ratios as these constants

here for example it tells us that in the

decay of the Higgs boson this could be

red is that the K of a Higgs boson into

a pair of fermions that it prefers to

decay into the heaviest fermions if it

has enough energy to do so it will

preferentially decay to heavy of

fermions rather than light fermions and

that's a consequence of this

the couplings here are larger so that's

one of the things that will become

important in in the LHC is to study the

properties of Higgs bosons and see if we

can detect evidence for these coupling

constants yeah this square roots of

probability sometimes their 4th roots of

probabilities you know it depends on how

many times you have to square but

they're young right they're related to

probabilities and so there's an

assumption here there's only one such

Higgs boson that everything I have made

the assumption that there's only one

type of Higgs bosons in various more

complicated theories beyond the standard

model there are often more than one and

then much of what I have to say for

example there are Higgs boson rolls out

there and they're super symmetric models

they're usually too Higgs bosons but

then you just modify it accordingly and

of course much of what I say have to has

to be modified because the weak

interactions are su to not u1 so what

I'm doing is giving you a kind of

simplified version of what the Higgs

phenomena does but thus far taking into

account all of the various gauge

interactions here's an interesting fact

all of the particles that have seen in

the standard model could not have a mass

if it were not for this shift sooner

before the shift of the Higgs field the

gauge bosons they normally do not have

mass and the only way to give them the

mass the only known way to give them

mass is this phenomenon of spontaneous

symmetry breaking associated with the X

field their mass is typically

proportional just to this F right so the

Z and W boson

all of the fermions because of this

peculiar property that the weak

interactions are purely left-handed the

symmetries

of the gauge theories do not allow you

to just write down

remember to postulate a mathematical

mass term for these fermions the only

way that they get mass is through this

shift of the field to say it yet another

way all of the masses of the known

particles are such that they are

proportional to this symmetry breaking

parameter F the shift of the Higgs field

that's a curiosity which may be deep it

may be important question question if

you have anti particles and they decay

beta decay would would the direction be

the opposite yeah yeah that's a good

point if an electron is purely

left-handed then it's anti particle is

purely right-handed you know but would

nevertheless we continue to call it

left-handed all right we call it we

still say the electron is left-handed

yeah

the positron would be right-handed the

positron which interacts with the zero

it's just a pure convention with is we

have a lot more experience with

electrons if we do with positrons so we

tend to name things by the we tend to

say the electron meaning the full

complex of objects that go together with

the electron are called left-handed

nevertheless the positron well an

electron and a positron have collided

together can make for example a z boson

so I guess it would be a left-handed

electron and a right-handed positron

could make a Zeebo

no no no you can create positrons in all

kinds of ways do you hit any particle

hard enough with anything and it will

make among other things positrons right

certainly not all positrons and that you

are made of for example you can make

positrons by just colliding an electron

with a photon you hit an electron hard

enough with a photon and you'll make the

electron will disappear but out will

come an extra electron and a positron

okay for example let's see if we can

work out the Fineman diagram that

describes that okay so the finding

diagrams basic Fineman diagram or the

basic vertex is electron electron and

photon but if we flip the lines around

we can turn this into electron let's

close a minus plus that's positron and

photon or better yet let's see so what

did I say we said electron collides with

a photon and makes an extra electron and

positron okay so here's the photon

colliding with the electron then another

photon emitted and that photon turning

into an electron and a positron so

that's a Fineman diagram a fairly

complicated finding diagram that would

take an electron and a photon and turn

it into an electron to electrons and a

positron so there's all kinds of

processes that can make

who are you asking in practice how much

can you are not that much so yes you can

you can you can change the energy of the

year varying their magnetic fields and

so forth I thought that one of the last

experiments against Lex follows but for

polarized electrons yeah it's hard to

make polarized electrons but once you

make them you can accelerate them so the

electrons are made in slowed electrons

are made which a polarize don't ask me

how to polarize that and remember but

then their accelerated is polarized

yeah but the details of Hari I can't

remember it it's not easy to do you need

your big magnetic fields and it took a

while to for them to to generate the

technology to do the polarized electron

beams color I made all the stage with

the scenery yeah

yeah so what about neutrinos okay so

neutrinos alright so in the standard

model and in old-time physics of the

before recent years it was not known

whether the neutrinos it was thought

that the neutrino was massless now the

massive then the trio was very very

small remember there are several

different neutrinos electron neutrinos

muon neutrinos very small within

experimental error they move with the

speed of light and that means that it's

possible for them to have only a single

handedness in the standard model

neutrinos all are left-handed the

standard model does not even contain

anything that you could call

right-handed neutrinos are

generalizations of the standard model

have right-handed neutrinos but those

right-handed neutrinos typically have a

very large mass and it's a complicated

story maybe we'll come to it but in the

simple standard model

neutrinos are massless now do we know

are they really massless than not we

know they're not we know they're not

because of neutrino oscillations so we

know they're not but their masses are

very small 10 to the minus 3 electron

volts or even smaller and so in

approximately they're very close to

massless they're not quite what actually

happens to neutrino is really curious

remember mass term is a thing which

turns left handed to right-handed so

it's a process in which left-handed can

make a transition to right-handed now ah

what happens with the neutrino there are

left-handed neutrinos and of course they

go along with right-handed anti

neutrinos of neutrinos left-handed then

the anti neutrino is right-handed and

one way of having a mass for the

neutrino is to have a left-handed

neutrino make transitions to

right-handed anti neutrinos mass is

always for firming

it's always left-hand turns into the

right hand turns into the left-hand

turns at the right hand processes which

involve that for neutrinos curiously the

right handed particle which the neutrino

can make a transition to is the anti

particle of the left left-handed

neutrino so that's an interesting fact

why could why could the electron real

electron why could the real electron not

get a mass by mixing by the left-handed

electron with the right-handed positron

we'd be pretty yeah you'd be pretty

amazed to see a electron turn into a

positron because of violate charge

conservation so that's not an option for

the electron why is it allowed for the

neutrino as no charge there's no charge

right the buzzword terminology for a

particle which gets a mass from a Dirac

equation it's very curious the thing on

the right hand side here is the anti

particle of the thing on the left hand

side for the Trino a particle which gets

its mass by mixing in this way with its

anti particle is called a Meyer on a

particle my Arana was my Arana the young

italian physicist i'm not even sure what

you mile or AA @ ra my Arana

who disappeared shortly after inventing

the my around a particle never was heard

of again i don't mean he wasn't

academically heard of i mean he was

never heard of again

nobody knows what happened to her

yeah we can we can talk about turns out

the mass of the Higgs particle is also

generated by the Higgs particle and has

also ordered the same F so we more or

less expect that the Higgs particle will

have the same order of magnitude mass as

the W and Z boson somewhat heavier but

but more or less the same but okay so

let's think about it now what we found

this is somewhat striking all masses in

the standard model traced back to this

parameter F if F was zero they would all

be massless all right all the particles

of the standard model with the possible

exception of the Higgs boson itself but

all the particles of the standard model

all the familiar guys there and even

many of the unfamiliar ones Z W and so

forth top quarks bottom quarks the whole

works

all of them masses are a response to

this F they're all proportional to F in

the formulas of particle physics why is

that why are they no particles in nature

whose masses might not be much much

larger than F well maybe they're all

particles which masses are much larger

than F we just haven't discovered them

yet why not because there are the limits

of our energies are roughly at about

that level now this number F in order to

agree with the masses of Z and W bosons

this number F thought of as a mass is

about 250 GeV if there were particles in

nature whose mass were much larger than

200 GeV or so we would not have

discovered them supposing there were

particles let me give you an example of

a particle in this context in this

slightly fictitious but but still

qualitatively correct context where a

particle

could get a mass that was not due to the

Higgs boson supposedly had a particle in

this weak interaction context where both

the left-handed and the right-handed

components both had the same charge with

respect to these weak interactions

suppose such a particle existed then

there will be no obstruction to having a

mass which had nothing whatever to do

with F it could have a mass which would

be arbitrarily big it could be much much

bigger than F it could be 10 to the 16th

times bigger than or even bigger than F

there would be no obstruction to it

having a mass having nothing to do with

this F ah there are other kinds of

particles that could have masses which

are not due to this F the thinking now

is that the natural mass scale of

elementary particle physics wherever it

comes from we can talk about where it

comes from is much much bigger than F

any particle that can have a mass will

have a mass and that mass will be much

much bigger than F it is only those

particles for which there are symmetries

which other there are deep underlying

reasons why in the absence of

spontaneous symmetry breaking they can't

have mass the gauge bosons themselves

the photon is one of them these

particles which are purely left-handed

they are forbidden from having mass

unless there's a spontaneous symmetry

breaking so maybe it's not so surprising

that all the particles which have low

enough energy to have been detected all

are the ones whose masses are coming

from the same origin namely a small

amount of spontaneous symmetry breaking

all the other particles which could have

masses independent of this F simply

apparently have

masses at some scale which is much

larger that's the thinking so it's not

in that sense the particle spectrum as

we know it consists of the particles

which would have been massless if the

specimen tree was not spontaneously

broken they're all responses to a small

amount of spontaneous symmetry breaking

that's the thinking in any case this may

or may not confer definitely could mean

that it depends of course on what you

mean by reality which which ones don't

play a big role are the ones which can

have masses they do not play much role

in ordinary physics now one exception is

the possibility of dark matter the best

guesses about theories of dark matter is

that the masses of them are much

significantly larger than this F

possibly by a factor of ten larger than

this F for such particles it's

unreasonable for various reasons to

think that they get their mass in this

way and so dark matter particles may be

the first indication of a spectrum of

particles whose masses do not come from

spontaneous symmetry breaking that's

thinking in Java at least this

particular spontaneous symmetry breaking

yeah well pensive cosmic rays can be

electrons it can be protons there can be

photons they what the mass is is the

mass of those particles they're very

high-energy but mass means energy at

rest right

what is art so you could ask me what is

the energy of cosmic rays

well basically anything up to about 10

to the 21 electron volts

so 10 to the 21 what's 21 minus 9 12 21

minus 9 is 12 10 to the 12th GeV which

is very very high higher than any

accelerator that we're going to build

incidentally cosmic ray collisions in a

certain sense will not be as high in

energy probe as accelerator probes and

the reason is because the cosmic ray is

banging into a particle at rest the

Hadron Collider will collide together

two particles and it's you may think of

it as twice the energy but it's much

more potent than that we can come to why

hitting a particle at rest with a high

energy is not typically as potent as

hitting two particles head-on with a

good deal lower energy so what will be

measured in CERN will be processes at

energies no still not as high still not

as high as the highest cosmic rays

versus inertia and that where is that

yeah well yes yes and now you can ask by

what magic is it that inertia and these

expressions in Dirac equations and so

forth correspond to the same physical

idea and that's more complicated but you

could go back to basic basic relativity

and you could have asked special

relative and you could have asked the

same question their definition two

different definitions of of mass one of

them is inertia or how hard it is to get

a thing accelerating and the other is

energy at rest why is the energy of an

object at rest related to the inertia of

how much how hard it is to accelerate it

that is contained in the rules of

special relativity but once you know

that then you might as well focus on the

definition of mass as energy at rest so

the question does not have to do with

particle physics it doesn't have to do

as to do it special relativity

exactly well a couples yeah yes this is

that's right um good

so that's correct

once it gets mass it stops the couple to

the gravity field now that's a little

bit not quite accurate photons don't

have mass photons do couple to the

gravity field what is it about photons

there wasn't that really couples to the

gravity field its energy energy energy

is the thing which really couples to the

gravitational field how do we know that

photons coupled to the gravitational

field they'd bend the trajectories of a

photon are deflected in a gravitational

field action equals reaction and so that

means that the orbit of the Sun is

slightly perturbed every time a photon

goes past it but that's pretty

negligible but just the fact that the

photons are deflected when they go

around the Sun means that it made them

that massless particles do couple to

gravity but particles at rest their

energy is simply their mass so if you

have two particles more or less at rest

the gravitational interaction between

them related to their mass this

acceleration is also really resistance

to acceleration is also related related

to energy not just David indeed it is

that's correct the resistance to

acceleration of a high-energy particle

is bigger than the particle at rest yeah

the only the only subtlety is that the

resist let's call to resistance the

resistance to acceleration if a particle

is moving down the z axis then there's a

different affective inertia of it if you

make a force along the z axis or if you

make a force perpendicular to the z axis

so there's no universal concept of mass

unique mass for our particle which is

moving depends on which way you push it

what

inertia is that's why people stopped

talking about the mass of moving

particles which mass and stopped talking

about that and defined mass to be the

energy of a thing at rest but yes some

it is correct that the more energetic an

object is the harder it is to flare well

in a certain sense it's not left-handed

or right-handed an electron at rest the

handedness is the relationship between

the momentum and it's particularly well

defined for high momentum behind

momentum the definition of a

right-handed particle is one whose the

spin is along its momentum and the

left-handed particle is one whose spin

is opposite so the answer is that there

is no definition of right-handed and

left-handed for a particle at rest it's

mostly useful for high-energy particles

their notion of handedness okay this

this now you really pushed me to the

edge of okay so all right there's a

subtlety which I haven't told you about

and it's the difference between what is

called chirality and he olicity and I

promised to tell you about it I've been

a little bit loose in what I mean by

handedness so let's come back to the

idea of handedness as I've defined it is

especially useful for high-energy

particles particles whose momentum is

very large when the particle has a very

small momentum the handedness of it is a

so god it's it's I'm losing my my it's

getting too late for this we'll come

back to it yeah I will I will explain

or

no F is a water 250 GeV the Higgs

particle as there's good evidence that's

a good deal lighter than that

o high-precision

experimental and theoretical comparison

between the properties the masses of the

Z and W bosons they would have a little

they would respond to changes in the

mass of the Higgs boson in a certain way

and from experimental knowledge of the

masses of the Z and W boson I would say

the bound on the Higgs mass is probably

that it's less than 160 GeV so that's

less than this 250 GeV but not by an

order of magnitude so I want to follow

up on a question I asked earlier about

the possibility of multiple minima and

it occurs to me that if you had

particles which you didn't see in

generations and that would that would

get in the way of having multiple minima

in that potential function that so you'd

have multiple F guys from one

confidential function yeah so if you had

a particle which didn't exhibit

generations then it wouldn't wouldn't

make sense let's let's let's come back

where we will talk maybe next quarter a

great deal about multiple minima and

what kind of different physics can take

place in different minima but simply

stated you can have anything happen

almost anything happen in another

minimum of the potential so I didn't

want to get into that tonight I'm

getting tired as you can see so ask me

some more questions of 50 if the energy

level that's required to answer them is

low I will do it but they have a class

next week

what's next three next Monday I mean

totally at the end of this course we're

gonna have another class next week

what's they are this is the ninth

lecture well then I suppose we have

another class I know I have to be away

at some point but I don't think that's

really 18th oh yeah yeah yeah yeah well

we don't have to have two classes and we

won't have two classes because I'll be

away for the for the 11th week but for

the tenth week we're which yeah let's

meet why not sure sure okay yeah

if I if I recover from tonight you know

yeah yeah

there are various scenarios for the

value of the higgs boson mass and in

some of them the range of energies is

quite easy it's the rate and the and the

things that things decay into sometimes

they decay into just invisible things so

the Higgs boson will not be the first

thing discovered that at LHC of course

it may be the first thing they

discovered if nothing else is discovered

but there's a lot of room for discovery

before the Higgs boson particularly if

they're super certain

some time ago I don't seem to have any

particles but because they have zero man

no no it does not have to do with their

mass it has to do with their absence of

having any kind of charge to distinguish

the particle from the anti particle so

the photon is uncharged with respect to

any kind of charge that we know about it

doesn't participate in weak interactions

it's not electrically charged

anti neutrino yeah they also know but

there are any nutrient there already

oh that's well are their anti neutrinos

well

No some people would say there's only

one kind of the tree no and it's both

left-handed and right-handed other

people would say there are neutrinos and

antineutrinos the point is the neutrinos

can mix together with the anti neutrinos

and form a massive Maya Rana particle

which is its own anti particle why

because it's a superposition of a

particle and the anti particle so it's

the some subtle quantum mechanics there

no well yeah yeah yeah we can talk about

that too it does but only what yeah it

does um remember neutrinos have weak

charges they interact under the weak

interactions and so the the weak

interactions provide this collection of

charges that that we've been discussing

and the neutrino is not uncharged with

respect to the weak interaction with

respect to the Z and the W boson in

particular the neutrino and the anti

neutrino interacted differently with the

Z boson

so you might say that with respect to a

Z boson the neutrino and antineutrino

have opposite charge they also have

lepton number which is another

unless the lepton number is not

conserved okay all right I'm nodding my

head yes but I know deep in my heart

that the answer is no and the reason is

that lepton number is not really thought

to be conserved right and it's connected

with this Maya Rana story and the mass

of neutrinos neutrino oscillations can

mix the Trino with anti neutrino and
