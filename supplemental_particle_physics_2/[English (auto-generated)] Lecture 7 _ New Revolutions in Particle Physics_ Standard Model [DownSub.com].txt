Stanford University so the goal of today

was to show you how a particle like the

photon particle like the photon can gain

a mass can get a mass from something

called spontaneous symmetry breaking

how it can gain a mass from something

called the Higgs phenomenon two

important ingredients that I haven't

emphasized tonight both of them

technical but also one of them more

technical and the other one of them

called spontaneous symmetry breaking and

the other called gauge invariance we

have to go through them if we really

want to seriously understand what's

going on there

mathematical ideas and so we can't avoid

mathematics as usual last time I think I

discussed a little bit an example of

spontaneous symmetry breaking namely our

very simple model of magnets with

magnets little magnets individual

magnets can either point up or down and

when the energy is such that the energy

is lower when they're parallel either

this way or this way and larger if

they're anti parallel there is no

fundamental asymmetry between up and

down to neighboring up little magnets

have the same energy as to neighboring

down magnets one up and one down has the

same energy as one down and one up so

there's no fundamental difference

between up up and down but nevertheless

because the spins are energy because

it's energetically favorable for them to

be parallel then all you have to do is

go very very far away let's let's

imagine now we're talking about the

ground state the state of lowest energy

this magnet has been frozen all its

energy sucked out of it which state is

it in you can think of two possibilities

they could all be up they could all be

down one up and one down anyways we'll

cost more energy but which is it are

they all up or are they all down well

the answer is determined by one spin

very very far away you go very very far

away and you freeze one of them just one

spin very very far away the effect will

be that its neighbors in order to save

energy we want to be parallel to it all

right so let's say the four are the six

neighbors around it depending on the

dimension of space and three dimensions

there are six neighbors on a square

light on a cubic lattice so it will tell

its neighbors look you want to save

energy

point the same way i point but then the

six neighbors have a bunch of neighbors

connected to them and so forth and so on

and the effect will be that that the

entire lattice if we really want to be

in the ground state will all point in

one direction so there is a symmetry but

the symmetry is spontaneously broken now

let's let's just distinguish that and

compare it with what I will call

explicit symmetry breaking explicit

symmetry breaking is different imagine

that instead a slightly different system

perhaps the same system but one added

ingredient there's a magnetic field and

the magnetic field points up in that

case the just an individual spin one

spin at a time forget its neighbors will

prefer to point along the direction of

the magnetic field prefer what does that

mean it means the energy will be lower

when it's pointing along the magnetic

field this is an explicit braking

there's something in the system which is

single down up as different than down

the expression for the energy is no

longer symmetric if all I had was one

spin the energy would be different to

for up and down

on and in that case it really doesn't

matter what you do very very far away

doesn't make much difference there's an

enormous savings of energy if all of the

spins are pointing along the magnetic

field if you try to take a substantial

number of them and flip them in the

wrong direction the energy cost would be

enormous it would be proportional to the

total number of spins that you try to

change

so one spin far away holding it in some

direction is not going to have much

influence far away why because if it did

have an influence far away and the lines

things up with it the cost and energy

would be enormous

so that's explicit symmetry breaking

yeah there's an article with no charge

that skin

oh we can as a magnetic magnetic moments

no charge but magnetic moments like the

Neutron Neutron has a magnetic moment

but no charge but spontaneous you mean

they would all fit at the same time or

will they propagate out well that's the

question

I mean in real world they propagate out

yeah yeah if you that's a good question

I mean if you had the oil spins lined up

in one way the raw in some way and then

you spontaneous case you came and you

flipped one of the spins and held it

down yes a wave would go out like that

not just like static dominoes yeah yeah

except in free division

whose you have multiple ways you would

have multiple ways point multiple

distant influencer we're going to talk

about waves ways of real you mean waves

of reorientation yeah we're going to

talk extensively about waves of

reorientation ah but ok so question how

would you know you find one of these

magnetic systems not a real magnet it's

just a mathematical model with spins

which can either be up or down you find

a sample and it's all pointing up you

want to find out whether it's

spontaneous symmetry breaking or let's

call it explicit symmetry breaking

what's the difference what are there any

phenomena which are characteristic of

one versus the other

the answer is yes in the case of the

simple magnets which can either be up or

down the special phenomenon associated

with the spontaneous symmetry breaking

is the existence of domain walls what is

the domain wall if you had a big sample

there's a big sample here and you

decided to do an experiment there's a

finite size sample but very big so you

go out to the boundaries let's say the

left boundary and you make all the spins

up you just freeze them you hold on to

them perhaps by putting the the spins on

the boundary over here this is

incidentally this is not time to space

directions just for simplicity you

freeze all of the spins upward over here

what do you expect to happen well of

course the system will save energy by

filling itself up with all up spins

parallel spins not because there's

anything around here which is favoring

up spins but just because each neighbor

influences it's all its neighbors and

says you'll save energy if you're

okay how do you tell the difference

between that and explicit symmetry

breaking which is the igloo which is the

presence of a magnetic field in the bulk

of the sample here orienting the spins

up

well one experiment you could do is you

could go over to this side over here and

place all of the spins down then what do

you expect in the two cases the two

cases you expect quite different

behavior if there really was a

preference an explicit symmetry breaking

but said you save energy by being up

then the effect of what's going on over

here would not be very important am i

propagate in a little ways but it

certainly would not flip a large

macroscopic percentage of the spins

because that just costs energy to turn

them relative to the explicit magnetic

field so if there was a magnetic field

pointing up the effect of turning them

down here would only propagate a little

ways in and would be too costly an

energy to turn over any large

macroscopic fraction of them on the

other hand if up is just as good as down

in other words if there is nothing

external to the system saying up is

preferred then the effect is quite

different instead they the favorable

energy configuration will be one in

which half the sample on one side is

down and half the sample on the other

side is up now the split might not be at

the center that's not so important but

this would be a perfectly good

configuration where half of them will be

up half of them will be down you cannot

find a state with lower energy there is

no state of lower energy than half being

up and half being down this would be

called a domain wall the separation

between the two types of behaviors would

be call

the domain wall so for this simple

example the phenomenon that would

characterize spontaneous symmetry

breaking would be the existence of

domain walls where on either side of the

domain wall there would be basically

identical things except reflected by 180

degrees the main walls would be the

existence of domain walls would be the

signal the signature of spontaneous

symmetry breaking down for this case now

we can think of a a field theory which

has very similar behaviors here's a

field theory we have a field let's just

call it Phi is green okay does green

work all right let's see it again black

is better or let's try or will they do

the black here it is all right

I feel fine now for the simplicity now

Phi is a real-valued field only one

component and it can take on any value

any real value from plus infinity to

minus infinity and there's a dynamics to

this field which is controlled by a

Lagrangian let's write a Lagrangian for

it's a relativistic field and the usual

expression for the kinetic energy of a

relativistic field is to differentiate

Phi with respect to the direction mu and

square that well you square with some

some signs plus signs and minus signs

that are characteristic of relativity

and that we describe by putting upper

and lower indices but basically this is

just the sums actually differences of

squares of the time derivative squared

sorry the the difference between the

time derivative squared and the space

derivative squared this thing here is

one-half Phi dot squared minus the

derivative with respect to X of Y

squared same thing for Y and so forth

and Z and we'll just represent that by D

mu Phi D mu Phi we could even represent

it more simply let's even represent it

by an even simpler notation let's just

call it 1/2 and the 1/2 is completely

conventional meaning to say it's a

convention but you could change it it

wouldn't make any difference to the

physics simpler notation would just be

to write D Phi squared and it means Phi

dot squared minus gradient of Phi

squared and then you can add another

term which is a potential energy a

potential energy minus V of Phi minus a

potential which depends on Phi potential

energy it doesn't depend on the gradient

of Phi the time derivatives a space

derivative it just depends on Phi itself

and imagine that V of Phi looks

something like this

completely symmetric

exactly symmetric with respect to

changing plus to minus

alright so here would be Phi equals zero

right over here let's call this point

Phi equals F and here Phi equals minus F

plus F and minus F and plus F and minus

F a completely symmetric this function

assume it is completely symmetric with

respect to flipping about the vertical

axis and under that case there will once

again be two ground States of a field

two states of lowest energy incidentally

the energy has a plus sign for vo5

Lagrangian has a minus the energy has a

plus sign there will be two states in

one configuration the field will sit at

this point over here Everywhere's in

space so everywhere is in our sample or

in space phi could be minus f now why

why can't it make a jump obviously the

energy is lowest if Phi is at this value

or this value but why can't it jump from

here to here without a big cost in

energy

but energy times well supposing

supposing the field just went the just a

sharp boundary here Phi equals F Phi

equals minus F everywhere is in this

sample Phi is equal to either plus or

minus F and so this potential energy

here is minimized but what about the

derivative energies here what about the

terms in the energy proportional to

let's say the derivative of Phi with

respect to x squared this direction

could be X then there's a huge jump or a

very sudden jump in Phi going from here

to here a sudden jump means a large

derivative in fact if the jump was

sudden meaning really concentrated the

derivative of Phi would be very big the

square of it would be even bigger and

you would pay a large price in energy

for a sudden jump on the other hand you

pay no price F Phi is either equal to F

or minus F Everywhere's

this is very much like the magnets lined

up are that and again is the case of

spontaneous symmetry breaking a

different possibility where there would

be no spontaneous symmetry breaking

would be if the potential energy instead

look like this

then the ground state would just be Phi

equals zero

well Phi equals zero is the same as Phi

equals minus zero and there would be no

bias so do you would not observe

anything in here you'll just have Phi

equals zero everywhere and there would

be no breaking of the symmetry of left

to right or of plus Phi 2 minus Phi

okay so that that would be the case of a

spontaneous this would be the

spontaneously broken case this would be

the unbroken case in one case the ground

state simply has the field equal to zero

in the other case there are two ground

States

two identical ground well physically

identical ground states and again in

this case here if you insisted that the

field was plus F on this end and minus F

on this end by you know going into the

system and holding it down then there

would be a transition somewhere is in

the middle from minus F 2 plus F it

would be costly in energy because of

these gradient turns but still you have

no choice you said it's plus on this end

- on this end and there would be a

domain wall down the dad down the center

yeah assuming that there's no influence

from second nearest neighbors only

nearest neighbors so why wouldn't

everything just be random everything up

and down up and down everywhere because

if you look at the secondary nearest

neighbors where they would be in the

same orientation as the as well as the

second nearest neighbor and interactions

also preferred parallel miss it wouldn't

make much a difference if you had a

situation where the first nearest

neighbor is preferred parallel and the

second nearest neighbors anti parallel

you might get into some kind of

competition ya know it refers to the

idea that there's really no fundamental

asymmetry there's a question of chance

which way it goes

or if not chance that you can you can

set off the difference by a very very

tiny perturbation very tiny perturbation

just one spin it is a kind of

instability it's a kind of instability

that that was an instability mean an

instability means that a very very small

perturbation on the system will change

it a lot all right so small in this case

it may mean that just one spin far away

is being tampered with you ordinarily

think that's not much of a change in the

system you go far you have a system

which is a million zillion miles by a

million million zillion miles and it's

loaded up with a huge number of these

spins and somebody off on Alpha Centauri

turns one of them over and what's the

effect the effect is would be of a

propagating wave which would come in and

it would take some time of course but

which would cause if you sucked all the

energy out of the system would cause the

ground state to be to realign itself is

starting out in one state and it's done

to the other or well it depends on the

particular physical situation all right

we'll say a little bit more about it at

high temperatures where there's lots of

random fluctuation it may be and

typically would be that the random

fluctuation would be such that on the

average there would be equal amounts of

up-and-down random fluctuation now you

start the Kulik you cool it and take

energy out of it and take energy out of

it which way is it going to go well the

answer is that it's a sort of random

thing a patch might form plus over here

- over here another some patchwork might

start the form to lower the energy where

they were parallel and then the patches

would connect themselves together and

the patches would try to line each other

and eventually it's a matter of random

chance which one will take over the

whole system okay so and that's that's

what's called spontaneous symmetry

breaking now in this case here you could

ask what would correspond to explicit

symmetry breaking anybody guess

you know know everyone in northern loved

one lower than the other yeah that's

right if the potential had an imbalance

so that one was lower than the other

then this would be an explicit symmetry

breaking and the ground state would sit

here ok so explicit symmetry breaking

that means it's something asymmetric in

if you like in a Lagrangian itself or in

the potential energy just an explicit

term in the fundamental set up to begin

with which favors one side or favors one

configuration instead of the other

that's explicit symmetry breaking in

that case if you take a very very big

sample there will not be domain walls it

would be very energetically unfavorable

to have domain walls the domain wall

will simply want to minimize the number

of wrong headed wrong directed spins or

wrong directed fields and simply move

over and try to wipe out the wrong spins

you might not be able to completely do

it but it won't the domain wall will not

be in the center because that will

require too many spins to be in the

wrong state to many degrees of freedom

too many points of space to be wrongly

aligned ok so I think we have the basic

idea of what a spontaneous symmetry

breaking is but now we're going to talk

and in this case the two cases that I've

discussed the symmetry which is broken

is a discrete symmetry in the spin case

it was spin up goes to spin down in this

case it's left goes to right it's not a

continuous symmetry a continuous

symmetry is one where you can

interpolate in between you can

interpolate continuously in between are

whatever configurations there are you

one is a continuous symmetry we'll

discuss it the

in a moment if I remember cuss it right

now su 2 su 3 whatever they're all

continuous symmetries where you can

interpolate configurations by using the

continuous generators of the group to go

from one configuration to another the

magnetic case real magnets real magnets

often in the real world have continuous

symmetries the continuous symmetry would

be not just can you flip a spin but you

can rotate a spin so for example some

examples of ferromagnets real

ferromagnets have continuous symmetries

where the spins prefer to be aligned all

right but it's not just up and down but

anywhere is in between all right in that

case the symmetry group is not just

reflection but rotations and it's a

continuous group so we will want since

we're interested in things like su 2 and

su 3 and u 1 we want to understand what

it would mean to spontaneously break a

continuous symmetry I'm going to do one

example tonight of both the notion of

continuous symmetry breaking what the

idea of a Goldstone boson is which

replaces domain walls and how this can

radically change its nature when the

symmetry has to do with gauge bosons

when it has to do with gauge bosons and

morphs from spontaneous symmetry

breaking into the Higgs phenomenon and

in particular how Figg Higgs phenomena

gives particles like the Z boson masses

how it provides a mechanism for them to

have masses so let's let's try to go

through that mathematics

alright first of all we're talking as I

said about continuous symmetries and I

don't want to do the general case it's

not interesting for us at this point to

do the general case let's do a very

specific case the specific case involves

a field

let's qualify again but Phi is now a

complex field instead of just existing

on the real axis instead of having a

value on the real axis it has a complex

value or another way of saying it is it

can take on any value in the plane the

two-dimensional plane

what is the plane the plane is the plane

of the real value of Phi and the

imaginary value of Phi and the complex

field Phi is Phi real plus I times Phi

imaginary and we'll just call it Phi

it's a field that depends on position

but knowledge of that field involves

knowledge of the two independent

components of it now these components

are not components in space this is just

a field which is composed out of two

fields and group together to form

something called the complex field Phi

and of course there's also a canonical

conjugate so another economical

conjugate a complex conjugate Phi star

which is just equal to Phi real minus I

Phi imaginary all right so Phi is a

thing which lives in the plane like this

you need to say the values that it takes

on are in a plane and let's suppose that

the in that case we would write the

kinetic energy here not in this form but

as the product of the derivative of the

conjugate of Phi times Phi itself this

is equivalent to the sum of two terms

one involving fire wheel and the other

involving fire imaginary you can rewrite

this as if you liked you could rewrite

it as D mu Phi

real squared plus D mu Phi imaginary

squared that's just using the idea that

the square of a complex of a complex

conjugate and a complex number times its

own complex conjugate is just the

product of the real components of the

square the real components plus the

square of the imaginary components

alright but let's so let's write it this

way and in fact the half is normally not

put there for complex fields now this

Lagrangian has a symmetry and the

symmetry is the u 1 symmetry let's write

it down where you place everywhere is

5x5 Prime and Phi prime is equal to e to

the minus I theta times Phi in other

words we multiply the field at every

point prime does not stand for

derivative here it's just a redefinition

of the field where we multiply it by e

to the I theta you know what that means

on the complex plane here now we rotate

it by angle theta now it's this

Lagrangian here does have that symmetry

where at the same time Phi prime star is

equal to e to the minus I theta times

Phi prime that I write that sorry Phi

star it is a constant at the moment

theta is a constant constant with

respect to space it could be any phase

but it is not allowed to vary from point

to point or time to time at the moment

ok why why is this invariant under that

because the e to the I theta will cancel

out the derivative let's write down the

derivative of Phi Prime I'm just I'm not

going to write D by D mu I'll just write

derivative abstract derivative

of five-prime is just e to the I theta

times the derivative of Phi Y because

theta is constant by assumption likewise

the derivative of Phi star prime y prime

star is e to the minus I theta times the

derivative of Phi star that means the

product of D Phi prime with D star Phi

prime is exactly the same the e to the I

theta is canceled out and so the

Lagrangian is unchanged by rotating the

field by a phase that's called a

symmetry that's what a symmetry means

operations that you can do which don't

change the Lagrangian of course I can

write other lagrangian's which don't

respect this symmetry but what else can

we add to the Lagrangian let's get rid

of these muse and just call it the

derivative of Phi times derivative of

Phi star you can remember that there's

some signs in there you can add a

potential so let's add a potential and

the Lagrangian that always means

subtracting V of Phi but I want via Phi

to have the same symmetry in other words

I want it to maintain the symmetry under

these phase rotations how do I do that

and the answer is very simple

you require that the potential is a

function only of Phi star Phi in other

words it's only a function of Phi real

squared plus Phi imaginary squared say

it again there was it was there question

no okay now it's clear that this

Lagrangian has the symmetry even with

the potential term I could break the

symmetry also two ways of breaking the

symmetry if I made the potential a

function of some other combination let's

say just five real by itself without

fire imaginary that would break the

symmetry okay what is the symmetry from

the point of view of this picture over

here it is the symmetry of rotating the

Phi plane

at every point just take whatever the

field is at any point in space and

rotate it here rotate all the fields

simultaneously and that is the symmetry

that we're talking about okay let's now

focus on two different kinds of

potential energies one of them

spontaneously breaks the symmetry the

other doesn't the situation is very very

similar to to the previous case first of

all as a simple example let's take a

potential well let's let's draw it now

let's write it let's just take the

potential Phi star Phi Phi star Phi

where is Phi star fine minimized at zero

it's it's always positive except when

it's zero and so the potential is

minimum right over here that point is

obviously a symmetric point with respect

to rotating the plane and so a potential

like this which I'll draw for you in a

minute that you know I'll show you a

will draw it in a minute a potential

like that is symmetric and there is no

either explicit or spontaneous symmetry

breaking associated with it the ground

state is just Phi equals zero completely

symmetric but now let's write another

potential let's write minus a times this

plus B times Phi star Phi squared this

potential has the property that near the

origin incidentally near the origin this

is bigger than this when Phi is small

fight to the fourth this is like fight

to the fourth five to the fourth is much

smaller than five squared so near the

origin the potential energy is not

minimum at zero but its maximum at zero

it thought that the field doesn't want

to be at zero field doesn't want to be

zero because it cost more energy for it

to be zero than to move away from zero

potential energy because of the minus

sign here favors

having five move away from zero on the

other hand it doesn't want to move too

far from zero if B is positive what

suppose B is positive if B is positive

for large Phi this is bigger than this

so when this is bigger than this you

don't want to have too much field

because this will get big and overwhelm

this what will happen a competition

between these two will take place and

there will be a favorable value of Phi

star Phi at some value we can draw a

picture let's draw a picture there's a

picture of the potential here's the Phi

plane

I'll make the five plane horizontal and

vertically is the potential energy in

the first case the first case was plus

and I didn't even write this here but we

could what does the potential look like

it's a function only of Phi star Phi

that means it's a function only of the

distance from the origin and the

potential would look like something like

this it would be a paraboloid it would

be a paraboloid which would have

complete rotational symmetry about Phi

equals zero here the energy is minimum

here the potential energy is minimum

that's five equals zero and if we move

away from Phi equals zero there's a

symmetry which makes sure that the

potential energy doesn't depend on angle

that's the character of the first case

where we just had plus a five star Phi

and in fact we could put in another term

it doesn't matter the only specific

ingredient here is that the potential is

upward and continues to go upward so

that the minimum of energy is right at

Phi equals zero under those

circumstances we would say there's no

symmetry breaking no spontaneous

symmetry breaking on the other hand

let's go back to the case with minus

here then the potential looks like this

it starts out at the origin and goes

negative

until the quartic term becomes as large

as the quadratic term and then it turns

up it's still symmetric about rotation I

know it's a little bit hard to draw it's

a surface of revolution meaning to say

it's symmetric with respect to rotation

about this axis here and the minimum is

not a point but the minimum lies on a

circle it lies on a circle in the

complex plane from this point of view

over here the minimum energy state is

somewheres along a circle of a radius

which is determined by the parameters

here you simply minimize this function

as a function of Phi star Phi and you

find out where that point is let's call

the radius F that's a standard notation

for it incidentally the minimum of the

potential is not at a point that's along

a track it's sort of along a track like

this but a track of radius F all right

now what is the ground state of the

system there are many ground States are

and they're all of the same energy they

correspond to the field being at any

point along the circle here everywhere

is a way to think about this is to

imagine that the field is a bunch of

little arrows not arrows in space arrows

in this abstract space they want to be

aligned along the same direction how do

I know that because if this variation in

the field from one point to another then

this term has a lot of energy in it okay

the gradient term so the field wants to

stay parallel in this internal abstract

space there there everywhere is in space

the field will want to lie at the same

angle

but are there's an ambiguity which

direction the energy is the same along

any direction as long as the field has

magnitude F in other words as long as

it's stuck in this track here or

equivalently in this track over here

then the energy is minimum can you say

anything beyond that no that's it the

energy will be minimum somewheres

Everywhere's along here okay but it will

cost energy to cause it to vary from

point to point even if it stays in the

track here there will be a cost and

energy of having a change from point to

point so that's the ground state the

ground state is any one of these

possible positions for the field we're

always sort of locked together again

spontaneous symmetry breaking but this

time the symmetry is a symmetry of

rotation about here all right now are

there domain walls interesting question

in this case are there domain walls so

let's go back to the Gedanken experiment

that we might imagine to check whether

there are domain walls we take a big

sample

and one place in the sample we put the

field at this point over here I don't

know let's just call it a E and at the

other end we put it at B so along here

the field lies in the a direction along

here it lies in the B direction what do

you think the ground state the state of

lowest energy subject to this constraint

is is it that the field is uniform until

it gets to some point and then makes a

rapid transition to the other value this

is no that's not the preferred energy

configuration and the reason is that

cost a good deal of energy because

making the transition from A to B

suddenly has the effect of making the

gradient terms in the energy large a

much cheaper thing to do is to have the

field gradually vary from here to here

this was not an option in the case where

the symmetry was just a reflection of

symmetry but now we have the option of

going smoothly from A to B so the field

at one end of space is at a and

gradually as we move across space at

very staying in the track here staying

in the track so that it never costs us

much potential energy and as long there

are two possible ways to go that's right

there are two possible ways so let's

resolve that by not putting this point B

let's put it over here that's just to

resolve that ambiguity but you're right

there was an ambiguity about which way

you go from one point to another if if

this point is over here not at the

extreme diametrically opposite point it

will pay to go this way and not go

around a long way because the field

gradient will be less

yeah if it was over here you could get a

trap the other way but given a pair of

points a and B unless you have this very

singular situation where they're exactly

diametrically opposed there will be a

particular best state but it will be a

state with smooth variation from one end

to the other

in other words effectively there's a a a

field in the system for which it does

not cost much energy to vary smoothly

from one place to another the energy

cost and having a gradient that's all

there is only the energy cost and having

a gradient and nothing else a field with

that character not by itself but will

we'll discuss what field it is a field

of that character that who has only only

gradient energy is massless it

corresponds to a massless particle

yong-go that might be a lure all right

because I did a little bit of going away

from that

be a little bit shorter ah okay so it is

a theorem this this you can prove that

the way to go from A to B in the minimum

energy is to have this angle very

linearly from one side to another that's

not hard to prove yeah and not going

away from the ground state just change

the angle linearly yeah that the that's

a theorem you can prove not too hard to

prove so that is that and how do you

prove it you prove it by using some

calculus of variation type minimization

you prove the answer is linear at this

point all the way yeah yeah yeah we have

not tilted the potential you could

imagine an explicit symmetry breaking

which would correspond to tilting the

potential a little bit right if you

tilted it then one point would be

preferred relative to the other and it

would be the ground state right okay

let's let's discuss from the point of

view of wave equations I just want to

remind you that for the point of view of

wave equations are a field with only

gradient terms in its energy is massless

what does it mean that it's massless it

means that the quanta associated with it

a massless but it also means if you

imagine a wave a wave of wave number K

in other words a wave which look like e

to the ikx going from one point to

another just a single field now forget

let's forget this complex field for a

minute just a field which goes like e to

the ikx ah then we would say that it has

a momentum K it has a momentum K K is

related to the wave number

the momentum K and if the energy in that

field goes to zero as K goes to 0 that

means that the quanta of that field have

zero energy when the momentum goes to

zero right K is like momentum if the

energy stored in the field with K equals

zero vanishes then that says there's no

energy for a particle of very very low

wavelength a very very long wavelength

excuse me very low wave number so and

that would correspond to saying a

particle at rest would have no energy

if a particle at rest has no energy it's

called a massless particle so if the

energy of a wave gets lower and lower as

the wave gets longer and longer

wavelength in other words is it varies

more and more smoothly then you call

that a massless particle that's that's

the case of a massless particle okay so

let's let's look at various potentials

let's start first of all with a

potential which looks like this M

squared over 2 Phi squared or Phi star

Phi it doesn't matter um

it's clear that if you created a wave

that varied from place to place no

matter how long that wave length was as

long as there was variation in the field

away from Phi equals zero there's going

to be an appreciable cost of energy why

because any place where the field is not

zero in particular if it's a wave like

this there's going to be a lot of places

where it's not zero and those places are

going to cost energy that is the case of

a massive particle that's the case of a

particle which has energy no matter how

long the wavelength of the particle is

okay um

if this is absent then a very very long

wavelength has very small energy the

only terms in the energy come from the

gradient terms and very very long

wavelengths have small gradients the

gradients are very very small when the

wavelength gets small and that's the

case of a massless particle so a term

like M Squared 5 squared is called a

mass term and it represents the mass of

a part we've discussed this before so I

won't go through it in detail again but

let me just show you how you can think

about decomposing in this case here

where the field likes to lie on this

circle here let's go through a little

bit of mathematics and see if we can

identify why there's a massless particle

and what that massless particle is the

massless particle incidentally just

corresponds to a wave where the field

stays in the lowest energy here if it

stays in the lowest energy then the long

wavelength excitations that just means

the field varies gradually from place to

place only an angle and never creeps out

of this track here that will have lowest

very low energy and will correspond to

something massless but let's see if we

can see some mathematics for it are we

doing yeah so let's take the potential

to be derivative of let's take the end

of the lagrangian to be derivative of

phi x the derivative of Phi star minus V

of v star Phi and now let's represent

the field in a new way not by the real

and imaginary part of the field but

let's write phi is equal to rho times e

to the I alpha what does alpha alpha is

the angle on the complex plane Rho is

the radial value

of the field in other words the

magnitude of the field and alpha is the

angle Rho and alpha are also fields Rho

and alpha can vary from place to place

and let's rewrite the Lagrangian in

terms of Rho and alpha the notice alpha

cos alpha naught Phi notice moving

around on the track here corresponds to

keeping Rho constant and varying alpha

so you can think of alpha as a field

which whose value is on this circle here

if you like or at least it has to do

with an angle Rho is a field which when

you change it changes the potential

energy and pushes you away from the from

the art from the minimum energy okay

let's let's try to write down what the

Lagrangian is in terms of Rho and alpha

very easy the derivative of Phi with

respect to any direction in space so in

space-time the derivative of Phi is

equal to the derivative of Rho times e

to the I alpha

that's differentiating this factor

leaving this one alone and then the

other term is plus Rho times the

derivative of e to the I alpha what's

that hmm did I leave out I sorry I

should have put Rho here at the Ritter

sorry what am i right there is a

derivative of Rho thank you

derivative of Rho times e to the I alpha

plus Rho times the derivative of e to

the I alpha and that's I Rho times the

derivative of alpha all times e to the I

alpha let's factor out e to the I alpha

and put it on the outside so that's the

derivative of v what about the

derivative of Phi star which multiplied

to work that out

derivative of Phi star that's exactly

the same thing except with a minus sign

over here

derivative of row - aye row derivative

of alpha times e to the minus I alpha

now what happens when we multiply these

two when we multiply these two the cross

term goes away and we just get two terms

one of them is just a derivative of Rho

squared the e to the I alpha cancels the

e to the minus I alpha here so that you

could just dispense with from the

beginning e to the I alpha goes away and

what do we get we get the derivative of

Rho squared okay and then we get plus

Rho squared times the derivative of

alpha squared and then finally V of what

is Phi star Phi in terms of Rho and

alpha Rho squared notice that the

potential only depends on Rho and not

alpha that's just a symmetry well now

let's say that that the very very low

energy excitations the very very low

energy excitations the very very long

wavelength configurations where the

field varies slowly from point to point

where it stays down in the track here

number one and number two were it very

slowly if we only have we don't have

much energy we're just trying to make a

very low energy excitation it's not

going to pay us to to change Rho very

much we want to keep Rho right on the

track here so in some approximation

where we don't ever excite any motion up

and down or away from the track here we

can just think of Rho is a constant Rho

doesn't vary from point to point and

therefore we can say that Rho is that

what did we call Rho we call it a other

Rho at the min

um f so we can just replace this by F

squared derivative of alpha squared and

then the rest of it has only to do with

Rho has to do with variations of Rho

from place to place climbing up and down

as well for example and also potential

energies that have to do with the value

of Rho the potential energy is going to

say hey don't get far from this point F

but still it's there this term what does

that term look like that term just looks

like the Lagrangian of a field with no

potential at all what about this F what

do we do with this F it's just a number

remember it's just a number it's fixed

it doesn't vary from place to place we

can absorb it into the definition

redefinition of alpha we can say let F F

times alpha be a new field what can we

call it you call it beta and this would

just become the derivative of beta

squared that would be characteristic of

a field with no mass right so the F here

that's that's unimportant as I said it

can be absorbed in here and just change

the definition from alpha to F times

alpha since it's a constant and this

just becomes the Lagrangian for a

massless field with no potential energy

at all right was the meaning of that the

meaning of that is if all you're allowed

to do is vary the angle here then

excitations of that type behave like

massless fields behave like fields whose

quanta have no masses now on the other

hand what about row row is an

independent field it's an independent

field that has a Lagrangian derivative

of Rho squared and a term V of Rho

supposing we choose the ground state to

be over here at this point remember we

could choose the ground state to be in

any direction then we can move in two

directions we can move around the circle

that's just exciting alpha we've already

taken care of that that's just a

massless excitation

that the costs no energy except for the

gradient terms but we could also move

radially outward what would happen if we

started the field over here radially

outward and then what's not giving any

any rotation yeah we'll just oscillate

about this point it would oscillate

about this point in very much the same

way as the field would oscillate about

the origin if there was a five star Phi

term that corresponds to a mass

oscillations if you take the field

Everywhere's and displace it it will

just oscillate back and forth that

corresponds to a mass in other words

this V of Rho here which could contain

for example a Rho squared or it could

contain a term which oscillates about

here that does correspond to a mass what

what a mass is is it's an energy that's

associated with zero momentum zero

momentum means that the field is

homogeneous and doesn't vary from point

to point zero momentum means no

variation at all so if there's energy

stored in a way na not away it's not

hardly a wave if there's energy stored

in the configuration where you move

everybody simultaneously then it would

and it just rocks back and forth that

frequency the frequency of its motion is

the mass all right so if you took the

field Everywhere's and you displaced it

up onto the side of the potential it

would start to oscillate everywhere

would correspond to a mass on the other

hand if you displaced it along the track

here nothing much happens if you're

displaced it Everywhere's along the

track it wouldn't there will be no

restoring force the restoring force

which gives a periodic oscillation

motion that is what a massive field does

it oscillates if you excited homogeneous

lee and okay whenever you have a

symmetry and the symmetry is part

whatever you have a continuous

symmetry in this case the continuous

symmetry is a rotation symmetry around

here and that symmetry is spontaneously

broken there is always the possibility

of changing the orientation of things

very gradually from place to place if

you have a continuous symmetry and in

that case you have mass less excitations

massless particles those particles are

called Goldstone bosons Goldstone boson

is a particle or a field Goldstone field

is a field which is massless which has

no restoring force by virtue of a

symmetry by virtue of the fact that

you're moving the field in a direction

the cost no energy okay so whenever you

have a spontaneously broken symmetry

there are Goldstone bosons

there are Goldstone boson well there are

Goldstone bosons let's leave it at that

in this case the Goldstone boson is or

the quanta of the field alpha which is

just motion along this track here that's

a very important concept in physics it

it's very important in particle physics

gives rise to massless particles which

we'll see are really unwanted in the

sense and it's also a very important

concept in condensed matter physics and

condensed matter physics for example

ferromagnets which like to line up can

be if a ferromagnet where where you can

orient the magnets in any direction with

the symmetry on the rotation there are

spin waves spin waves are gradual

variations of the direction of spin from

point to point

gradual and for the same reason that

I've described here a very gradual

variation of direction of spin from

place to place is not costly an energy

cost almost no energy and those spin

waves behave like massless particles so

the phenomena or the idea of Goldstone

bosons is a really important concept in

field theory in condensed matter physics

are where else does it appear all kinds

of places

is there any physics which is indeed a

field theory of condensed matter physics

in general relativity it also appears

but they won't tonight a long elastic

string is in exam oceans the waves on a

long a long string let's just take it

not on a string of string theory just

you know a longer rubber string from one

place to the next long that's an example

of a Goldstone boson or Goldstone field

what would be the symmetry associated

with it can you guess I'll set up I'll

set up an example for you forget gravity

gravity is not important here let's

suppose there's a pole over here another

pole over here ring around this pole

with a string connected to it and a ring

around here the reason I've set it up in

this way is so that you can move the

whole thing up and down like that okay

we know that if we make this very very

very long there are massless waves which

propagate up and down it massless means

they cost very little energy only

gradient energy can you guess what the

symmetry in this case is translation up

and down right as I said imagine no

gravitational field it costs no energy

to move this whole thing up or down so

it's a symmetry its translation symmetry

just translation symmetry up and down so

first of all is a symmetry next you can

imagine changing the orientation or not

orientation but position gradually as

you go from point to point

this Goldstone boson idea where you do

will you imagine a little symmetry

transformation but a gradual change from

one point to another what would that

look like now we just look like a very

slow variation of the of the vertical

position so an overall motion up and

down costs no energy and a very small

variation across here will also cost

very little energy and the waves the

long wavelengths which propagate up and

down a very very long string are also

Goldstone bosons they're Goldstone

bosons of the symmetry of translation

spin waves are Goldstone bosons of

rotational symmetry and this field is

the Goldstone boson of a u 1 symmetry

Yorn symmetry here now well if the thing

was standing still there's no momentum

oh you want you want to give it some

oscillation energy be careful be careful

what you mean about momentum you're

speaking about a vertical momentum yeah

yeah um vertical yeah we could certainly

make it have zero vertical momentum but

what about horizontal momentum yeah well

no there's there's waves there's waves

assert with wave numbers so it's

actually if you had the standing wave it

would be a linear superposition of plus

momentum and minus momentum so what I

would mean by momentum in this case

would not be the vertical momentum but

the momentum along the wave along the

along the wave axis the vertical

Direction here is just to stand in for

some internal

the symmetry good another example

another example of slinky let's say you

pin down the slinky at two ends

everybody know what a slinky is yeah you

notice the key is you can move the whole

slinky how is horizontally doesn't cost

any energy alright so there's a symmetry

of horizontal and just think of it as

being infinitely long for all practical

purposes that if you move it

horizontally costs no energy so there's

a symmetry in this case it's a

horizontal motion on the other hand you

can imagine slowly varying from place to

place how much you translated it and in

that case it would make a wave tighter

over here less tight over here but if

you do it slowly enough then this then

the in the wave will not cost you much

energy if you do it slowly enough from

place to place if there are no big

gradients or won't cost you much energy

so in this case the symmetry would be

translation horizontally and the waves

on a slinky are also sound waves are

also Goldstone bosons they also

correspond to translation of all the

molecules if you have a sample a system

with our infinite system with lots of

molecules and you translate all the

molecules it costs you no energy but if

you translate them little differently

over here than over here than over here

that creates a very long wavelength

pressure wave or density wave those are

also Goldstone bosons and they all have

a character that they cost no energy

when the wavelength goes to infinity or

when the momentum goes to zero and we

call them massless okay so we've seen

some connections now between symmetries

and massless bosons called gauge bosons

there are Goldstone bosons Goldstone

bosons I'm sorry that I apologizing to

my friend Goldstone who was a friend of

mine

I call them gauge my mistake sorry

Geoffrey now anybody instantly fails

this course if they say gouache now

let's talk about a totally different

subject also connected with you one

symmetry like this so it's not totally

disconnected let's talk about gauge

invariance I'm not sure we'll put the

two concepts together tonight it may

take till next week another concept

called

gauge invariance also associated with

this u 1 symmetry remember that u 1

symmetry symmetry under this kind of

operation is what we identified earlier

in past lectures with electric charge

conservation it doesn't have to be

electric charge but let's think about

electric charge we're going to wind up

with gauge bosons with mass well the

real photon doesn't have a mass but we

could be thinking about some other gauge

boson like the Z boson which does have a

mass but so for the moment I'll just

call the charge electric charge but it

might not be electric charge it might be

something of a different character and

we're thinking about something which is

not really electric charge but we did

identify the symmetry of this type with

the conservation of the electric charge

carried by the quanta of the Fifield

charges of various kinds are always

carried by fields which are complex and

the conservation law is associated with

the symmetry the symmetry is associated

with the u1 transformation namely

multiplication by a phase

okay we've talked about this at length

previous time so we won't go into it

again but let's uh let's erase this

squiggles here I'll leave this up

because we use it again

and this is the symmetry that we're

interested in files to five-prime now

question must wins

must we require in order for it to be a

symmetry must we require that theta is

constant over space are we allowed to

make transformations where theta can

vary from place to place

not theta u theta are we allowed to

imagine transformations where the

symmetry parameter theta all right now

theta is not a field now it's just a

symmetry parameter where it is allowed

to vary from place to place in other

words where we rotate the phase of a

field differently in some places than

others is that a symmetry so let's find

out let's find out by doing such an

operation and seeing whether it changes

the Lagrangian or not that's the test if

you think something might be a symmetry

try it out by applying it to the fields

and then stick them back into the

Lagrangian and see if the Lagrangian

changes okay so here's our

transformation v prime is equal to e to

the I theta of X where X could be space

or time space and time in general

space-time let's write it

running out of ink again let's try blue

oh good

okay so here's our symmetry operation

let's up let's calculate the Lagrangian

ah let's calculate our let's let's first

calculate remember what goes into the

Lagrangian what goes into the garlic

Ranji and is the squares of some

derivatives and maybe some potential

energy so let's start with derivatives

the derivative arbitrary direction it

doesn't matter what direction pick up

directions base or time and calculate

the derivative of v prime is v prime

alright well first of all it will

contain e to the I theta times the

derivative of Phi right the unmodified

the before the transformation takes

place and then it will contain a second

term and that second term will be Phi I

Phi derivative of theta with respect to

x times e to the I theta in fact let's

factor e to the I theta out it's an

overall multiplicative factor notice

there are two terms one of them that I

write this correctly I think I did yeah

one of them doesn't care one way or the

other whether theta varied with respect

to X or not that was this term here the

other term actually involves the

variation from point to point of theta

okay now let's write the Lagrangian as

we might think of it in terms of Phi

prime it contains we know Phi prime

we're interested in derivative of Phi

prime derivative of Phi star prime oh

let's write let's write the derivative

of

the conjugate the derivative of five

prime star that's just derivative of 5

star minus I Phi star derivative of

theta with respect to x times e to the

minus I theta now what we're going to do

is we're going to multiply these two and

see if it's the same as just multiplying

the original derivatives of Phi and 5

star

well obviously the answer is no because

there are some extra terms here but

let's see what they are let's just check

first of all the e to the I theta is

will cancel out so when I multiply the

derivative of Phi prime times the

derivative of Phi prime star at least

these factors will cancel out in other

words the factors will cancel out if v

theta doesn't depend on position if

theta didn't depend on position then

these would cancel out so let's just

erase them well I'm not going to erase

them I don't want to write the wrong

equation so I'll leave them up there but

when I multiply these together I'm going

to get well actually this is all I was

hoping to get I was hoping to get the

original Lagrangian back and show that

the Lagrangian is invariant but it's not

there's a couple of extra terms first of

all is a term I let's see whether there

is I Phi D Phi star minus Phi star D Phi

this is not zero this is Phi D

derivative of five star this is five

star times the derivative of Phi this is

not zero times D theta by DX that's no I

didn't want that there and then finally

there's the squared term which is Phi

star Phi five star Phi times derivative

of theta with respect to x squared well

that's a disaster I mean it's a disaster

if we were hoping that this would be a

symmetry it's not a symmetry the new

Lagrangian when expressed in terms of

the Lagrangian when expressed in terms

of five prime is not the same as the

Lagrangian when expressed in terms of

Phi what about the potential energy if

the potential energy is a function only

of Phi star Phi then Phi star Phi will

not change when we do one of these

symmetry transformations even if it

depends on space so V the potential

energy that's symmetric but the kinetic

energy the derivative terms in the

energy are not symmetric and if we trace

it down we see what the problem is the

problem is simply associated with the

fact that the derivative of Phi prime is

not the same as the derivative of Phi

well let's go to the upper equation even

if we ignore this e to the I theta that

does cancel even if we ignore that the

derivative of Phi prime contains this

extra term so we just don't have a

symmetry well can we do anything to

restore the symmetry is there anything

we can do Lagrangian theory well yes of

course we could just throw away these

terms in the Lagrangian that would not

be a very interesting Lagrangian with

just the potential has no interesting

dynamics whatever all right the answer

is yes but to do so you have to

introduce more fields and the additional

fields are the gauge boson fields in

this case if we were really talking

about electromagnetism it would be the

electromagnetic field all right so let's

introduce the electromagnetic field

incidentally a transformation like this

which depends on position just are a

symmetry a hoped-for symmetry

transformation which depends on position

like this is called a gauge symmetry I

do actually I do know where the term

came from but it's a historical

glitch it doesn't have to do with tire

gauges or anything like that it's not

important where it came from the term

but that's called

a gauge symmetry gauge symmetry implies

like the symmetry parameter can be

chosen to vary from place to place

now remember theta is not itself a field

it's just a generalized symmetry

parameter which is now allowed to vary

from place to place what's actually

happening here is when we make the phase

of a field vary from place to place

we're picking up a little bit of

gradient energy the gradients are

changing a little bit on us and so we're

picking up some gradient energy that

wasn't there before that's all okay

let's uh let's in example you have yeah

okay would that be like when you had the

circle of the constant altitude that'd

be like a response in that circle no no

it's just a gradient it's just if we

make a configuration where the field

where the phase of the field varies from

place to place it costs energy that's

all yeah that's all that's all it's

happening here but I've been very

explicit about it and I've identified

this as the villain and the problem here

this term here right so the question is

can we find some clever way to cancel

that out now why should we want to do

that ultimately it's an experimental

fact that that all of the interactions

of nature are associated with gauge

symmetries like this or not all the

interactions but all the gauge

symmetries all the gauge interactions

photons z bosons W bosons all are

associated with symmetries not just of

the kind where you can rigidly

Everywhere's do the symmetry

transformation but symmetries were you

graduate when it doesn't even have to be

gradual we an arbitrary variation of the

symmetry parameters from place to place

okay so let's let's

say what's the ingredient that you have

to add you have to add a new collection

of fields in this case just one new

field or I should say four new fields

one for each direction of space you must

add a four vector of fields and that

four vector is if this were

electrodynamics would just be the vector

potential the vector potential mu four

vector potential out of which you build

the electromagnetic field I'll just

remind you quickly what the connection

is are the electric field well first of

all the time component of a is the

electrostatic potential its gradient and

space is the electric field the space

components of a form a three vector and

the curl of that three vector is the

magnetic field I won't bother writing it

down this is the standard vector

potential out of which you build the

electromagnetic field tensor composed of

electric and magnetic fields we'll come

back to that but let's add in to the

symmetry operation we now ask when you

add a new field and you're interested in

the symmetry you always have to address

the question how does this new field

transform when you do the symmetry

operation in other words if we do the

symmetry operation that takes us from

five to five prime is there also

something that we have to do to a to

take us from a to a prime and the answer

is yes because the justification for

this is the result in the end that you

can keep gauge invariants but what you

do to a is you just add to it the

derivative mu of theta in other words

the transformation property of a is not

some multiplication by a phase of a but

just adding to a the gradient of theta a

is a four that

the derivative of theta is also a

four-vector that's the operation okay

that that will allow us to have a

symmetry next we have to change the

definition of the Lagrangian and the

definition of the Lagrangian is the new

definition of Lagrangian will be to

replace ordinary derivatives by a new

kind of derivative that's called the

covariant derivative it's not got it's

not the covariant derivative of general

relativity

it's the covariant derivative of gauge

theory let me let me define it for you

the fine D mu on Phi a covariant

derivative of the charged scalar field

or let's say yes the different look at

the covariant derivative is defined to

be the ordinary derivative we can take

away these mules if we want the wouldn't

cover but that's what I leave in plus

and get the sine straight plus I mu

times Phi definition that's the

definition of the covariant derivative

if you like you can just think of it as

a replacement of derivative by

derivative plus I times AE now that may

not mean that really doesn't mean

anything by itself it's something which

acts on a charged field this is

definition of the covariant derivative

same thing or the analogous thing for D

mu Phi star it's equal the d nu v star

now - minus I a new five star

keep in mind this wouldn't make any

sense if I was a real-valued field why

not because the fire was a real-valued

field we wouldn't want to add something

imaginary but fires itself a complex

field and so adding something additional

complex that's fine no problem okay this

is the definition of the covariant

derivative and the kinetic terms in the

Lagrangian forget that if we get the

potential terms for a minute the kinetic

terms in the Lagrangian are just

replaced by the square or D mu Phi times

D mu Phi star and let me show you why

that is gauge invariant why that now has

the invariance that was lost over here

how those extra little trick of

inventing an extra field giving it a

transformation property now takes a

Lagrangian which did not have this gauge

invariance and makes it gauge invariant

we don't even have to work out the

Lagrangian it's enough just to look at

the covariant derivatives let's prove

let's find the connection here's Phi and

Phi prime where it was fine fine fine

here's fine and Phi Prime

let's calculate the covariant derivative

of Phi Prime let's calculate the

covariant derivative of Phi Prime and

what we want to show is that the

covariant derivative of Phi prime is

essentially the same as the covariant

derivative of Phi e that would then

establish that the new Lagrangian which

involved the square of these was really

invariant so let's check that out

let's calculate let's recalculate a

covariant derivative of Phi prime that's

equal to first of all the first term is

just the ordinary derivative of Phi

Prime and there it is up there

derivative of Phi plus I Phi derivative

of theta with respect to X I wonder if I

have the sign wrong someplace I may have

a sign wrong here let's see I think we

can fix the sign by changing the sign of

it I think over here

if it comes out wrong we'll change it

back again okay

now that's the first term in the

covariant derivative of Phi Prime just

the derivative of Phi Prime but then we

have to add plus I something times v

prime what do I want to put over here a

a prime a prime because I'm calculating

the covariant derivative of the primed

fields so I want to put there a prime

all right so let's put a prime in what

is a prime a prime is a mu minus our D

mu theta the MU theta times sorry this

is Phi prime mu minus D mu theta all

times v prime is that right I think

that's right our Phi

and I must have left an out an overall

phase you know yeah both of them have a

factor of e to the I theta now you look

at it here was this extra nasty term

which destroyed the invariance of this

expression all right but here is exactly

the optimal an opposite sign one term

coming from the transformation of the

derivatives of theta and the other term

coming from the transformation of AE

notice they're exactly the same I hope I

Phi here we have i phi e to the I theta

and D theta by DX that's the third would

be the D theta scale it of all the Meuse

so this term and this term just

derivative of theta this term in this

term are exactly the same they cancel

we've succeeded in canceling out or

playing off the transformation

properties of the derivative with the

transformation properties of a and

causing the extra term to cancel so what

do we find we find that derivative or a

covariant derivative of Phi prime is

exactly the same as the covariant

derivative of Phi

except for this factor e to the I theta

here we have to put that back what about

the covariant derivative of the complex

conjugate by prime star that's equal to

the covariant derivative of v star times

e to the minus i theta and guess what

when we multiply this by this the e to

the I theta is canceled out and the

Lagrangian is gauge invariant so this a

field here was an invention of the

nice invention are two sort of forcibly

make the lagrangean be gauge invariant

but we had to invent a transformation

property of the gauge field itself of

the vector potential itself okay now

next we're missing something in the

Lagrangian what are we missing oh yes of

course we are missing the potential

let's let's add that in we can we can

multiply this by this and get ya D mu

Phi Lagrangian is B mu Phi D mu Phi star

minus V of v star Phi this was gauge

invariant to begin with we don't have to

modify that but we are missing something

rather important than a gauge theory oh

yeah

this wouldn't be a very interesting

gauge theory without some dynamics for

the vector potential itself now the fact

the potential is really the thing which

out of which you create the electric and

magnetic fields okay anybody know what

the Lagrangian for the electromagnetic

field is anybody know what the energy

for the electromagnetic field is e

squared plus B squared how about the

Lagrangian it's a squared minus B

squared a squared minus B squared but it

can also be represented in terms of the

field tensor so let's write it in terms

of the field tensor the field tensor is

called F mu nu and I'll just remind you

what it is F mu nu is an anti-symmetric

object it's the derivative in the mute

direction of a nu minus the derivative

in the knuth direction of a mule so it's

a kind of four-dimensional curl

it's in the diagonal components of 0 F 0

0 is 0 why is that because it's D 0 a 0

times D 0 a 0 minus D 0 a 0 at 0 all of

the diagonal elements are 0 its anti

symmetric on them you know interchange

and its components with one space in one

time or they the component of F mu nu

with one space and one time is the

electric field it has one space a

component and that determines the

direction of the electromagnetic field

and what about the terms with space

space components the magnetic field for

example F XY is equal to be Z where B is

the magnetic field and so forth and

cycler throw so this is the

electromagnetic field tensor and the

standard dynamics the Maxwell ordinary

Maxwell dynamics is determined by a

Lagrangian and the Lagrangian is just F

squared is just F mu nu F mu nu raising

the indices is just a couple of sign

changes here and there the Lagrangian is

e squared minus B squared the energy is

e squared plus B squared but the

important thing is that the lagrangian

for the electromagnetic field is

involves nothing but f mu nu itself how

about F mu nu is f mu nu gauge invariant

let's check it to find out we have to

calculate F mu nu Prime well that's just

equal to D mu a prime mu minus D nu a

prime mu alright but now let's remember

that we erase what a prime is we did a

prime is just equal to a I think it was

minus the derivative of

failure all right so let's just plug it

in this is going to be derivative mu of

a new are minus the derivative of MU of

the derivative of Nu of theta I've just

plugged in for a prime a and then the

derivative with respect to Nu of theta

what's going to happen when I put this

term in its got to subtract derivative

new of a mu and then it's going to add

plus d nu D mu of theta okay but the new

D nu theta is the same as D nu D mu

theta it doesn't matter which order you

differentiate in this is just the fact

that the order of differentiation

partial differentiations immaterial

until this cancels and what are we find

we find that F prime is the same as f

this is f so the electromagnetic field

tensor is gauge invariant that means

that we can construct a completely gauge

invariant dynamics of the

electromagnetic field coupled to a field

whose quanta are charged particles these

is this is the field whose quanta are

charged particles what is it it's D mu

this whoops this is mistake here this is

d mu only these covariant derivatives

not ordinary derivatives a potential and

ad plus F squared I'll just call it f

squared meaning if you knew you know the

appropriate thing a squared minus B

squared there's some numerical factors

which are conventional is usually a

quarter in front of this but that's

that's not important

the important thing is all terms here

are gauge invariant so we've discovered

the fact that we can promote a symmetry

like u1 here to a local symmetry a local

symmetry means that we can locally vary

the phase or we can locally do the

operation whatever

is from point to point and still have

the symmetry but it's always at the cost

of an extra field an extra vector

potential field and that vector

potential field can also be assembled

into a Maxwell Lagrangian that would

determine Maxwell's equations Maxwell's

equations coupled to charge carrying

matter that's what this is okay what can

we not add let me tell you what we can't

add and still be gauge invariant first

of all we can't add potentials which are

functions other than functions of five

star five if there were functions of

just a real part of Phi that would kill

the symmetry but as far as modifying the

electromagnetic field what we cannot add

in is a term like let's call it M

squared over 2 times a mu M you remember

the mass term for a boson field is

typically an M squared times the square

of the field a mass term for a photon

would be a term like this if we added

this term to the Maxwell theory here we

would be adding a mass to the photon

however it's forbidden if we want the

theory to be gauge invariant this is not

gauge invariant this is not the same not

equal to M squared over 2 a prime mu a

prime mu so this is forbidden by gauge

invariants there was no way by hand to

give the photon a mass that's what this

means the photon is necessarily massless

if you believe in gauge invariants and

every physicist believes in gauge

invariants for a wide variety of reasons

including mathematical consistency the

theory really breaks down badly if if

you try to do this

all right so the photon can't have a

mass or can it or can it is there no

device here by which taking this

Lagrangian just as it is is there any

trick that we can do to give the photon

a mass let me tell you right now what it

is we'll do it next week if we

spontaneously break the you one symmetry

by making the potential here have one of

these shapes like this so if the field

likes to sit over here that will mean

that the U 1 symmetry is spontaneously

broken not explicitly and spontaneous

symmetry breaking that's okay I mean is

this Lagrangian is gauge invariant the

spontaneous symmetry breaking will have

the effect of giving the photon a mass

and it will also miraculously remove the

Goldstone boson so the effect of

spontaneous symmetry breaking is twofold

it removes the Goldstone boson that was

associated with slow variations of Phi

from one point they phase of Phi on the

one hand at the same time gives a mass

for the vector potential so it gives a

mass to the photon now the photon meal

photon doesn't have a mass but the Z

boson does this is call we're going to

work this out next time we work out

we'll work it through next time and just

see how spontaneous symmetry breaking

gives rise to a mass for the gauge boson

that's called the Higgs phenomenon and

this would be an example of how the

Higgs phenomena gives mass to a particle

which mathematically you're not allowed

to just put in a mass by hand all right

that's the that's the signature or the

basic idea of the Higgs phenomena that

there may be deep mathematical reasons

why you cannot just by hand give a

particle a mass but spontaneous symmetry

breaking can do it

what I'm telling you is that if you have

some prenup first statement you can

create a Lagrangian which is gauge

invariant okay second statement the

coupling between charge carrying fields

and the electromagnetic potential would

become inconsistent if it were engaging

right I'm not going to try to

demonstrate that it really does become

mathematically inconsistent unless it's

gauge invariant so why should you

believe what is it what is the question

the question is now the answer is that

you can construct a gauge invariant

Lagrangian the result is a nice

consistent mathematical structure of

gauge theory if you try to do anything

else you will wind up with a theory

which in quantum mechanics which will

have some terrible things

it'll have negative probabilities in it

even worse things and but I'm not going

to go through that gauge invariance is

an extremely fundamental principle in

theoretical physics whether you like it

or not and for our purposes I think we

just have to accept it we can also

accept it as a empirical fact that all

of the particles namely photons z bosons

w+ and w- bosons are

nature seems to have chosen their

lagrangians to be exactly gauge

invariant it's a good thing because we

don't want negative probabilities in a

theory by saying there's an additional

field and you just arch in the plane

they keep it that way we have to add a

new field in order to implement the

symmetry right and then try using equal

guarantee measure so that's what I

understand

do you feel proud yeah that's right but

we had to add a new field to do it

without the new field we could not keep

now this is much deeper mathematics here

that I haven't discussed fiber bundles

all kinds of all kinds of interesting

mathematics a mu is technically what a

mathematician we call a connection and

there's all sorts of interesting

mathematics which we are not going to

get into the Goldstone boson was a

feature of the theory without vector

potentials and without gauge invariants

where the Goldstone boson was the energy

of the Goldstone boson was exactly the

energy of making these very variable

phases but now we find that there's a

way of making the variable phases

without a cost in energy why because the

Lagrangian is invariant under those

gradual change changes of phase what

does that mean that means there's no

cost in energy in this gradual change of

phase no Goldstone boson but we'll do

that next time we'll do it next time

we'll see that this Lagrangian does not

have Goldstone bosons and it does have a

mass for the photon

so how do we reach me we're in rivers

I don't think wonder if you stopped

flowing a straight line on a relatively

label plane with the increases equal

just yeah

not that I know of but I would not be at

all surprised if somebody has found the

gauge theory of rivers I don't know of

any connection I do know that there are

connections with the emotion and shapes

of animo

now well I would be totally surprised if

there was some connection but none that
