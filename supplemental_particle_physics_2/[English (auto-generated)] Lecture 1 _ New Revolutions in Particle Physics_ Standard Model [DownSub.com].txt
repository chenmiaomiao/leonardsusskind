Stanford University okay so we've talked

about a lot of things so far fields

quanta of fields the relationship

between fields and particles that's the

relationship between fields and their

quanta or the quanta the quanta are the

discrete indivisible units of energy

that quantum mechanics implies for waves

for waves and waves of course are fields

fields and waves are more or less the

same thing we've discussed the

properties the oh not the properties of

individual particles very much but we've

discussed some general properties the

properties of having energy momentum the

properties of having spin and the

property of either being a fermion or a

boson every particle is either a fermion

or boson fermions are the particles that

don't like to live together in the same

state bosons are the particles that do

like to congregate and do condense into

the same state we've talked about wave

equations on occasion or the field

equations if you like more generally

varies four kinds of field equations and

we talked about how field equations can

be generated from lagrangian's

from action principles the quantum

mechanical version of the Lagrangian is

a kind of tool for codifying or

codifying whatever the right word is

codifying the interactions between

particles various terms in the

Lagrangian things like for example

products of fields represent processes

which we can call vertices where

particles come in and other particles go

out that would for example be a term in

the Lagrangian which would have four

powers of a field in it so we've talked

about these general things or we haven't

talked very much about specific

particles tonight well I expected to

spend the first half hour beating around

the bush bush a little bit

looks like I spend a few more minutes

beating around the bush but then I want

to come to really writing down what the

particles are you know who are the

players in the drama and start going

through them more or less well I'm not

quite one by one but in groups and

trying to give them some personality

give them some names some properties and

also what it is they do and how they how

they come into into physics into

ordinary physics okay but before I do

that there's kind of a triangle of

concepts that we've discussed two legs

of but not the third leg very much the

triangle is particles or field quanta

particles fields and in modern physics

pretty much for every elementary

particle now we're going to have to

think very hard in the future at tonight

what is an elementary particle and what

is a composite particle we will come

back to that and you might think I mean

everybody here probably has some answer

if I were to ask you how do you

distinguish a composite particle from an

elementary particle and you will always

be frustrated you will always find some

slippery reason that your definition

didn't work but for the moment let's

nevertheless imagine that there are

elementary particles and that the

elementary particles are the quanta of

elementary Fields fundamental fields in

the in the theory are and so they're

more or less than one-to-one

correspondence but there's a third leg

to this triangle anybody know what it is

of course you don't know what I'm

thinking so even if you didn't know what

it was you still wouldn't know more

forces forces forces and in a certain

sense forces force forces okay basically

for every field

there is a particle for every field

there is a force electric field gives

rise to electric forces gravitational

field give rise to gravitational forces

it may be less obvious to you what the

what the electron field electron has a

field

it also gives rise to forces and we'll

talk about them a little bit so this

kind of a correspondence that goes this

way is a correspondence code which goes

this way there must also be a

correspondence which goes this way a way

of thinking about forces which is not

based on fields but which based on

particles if this correspondence so this

triangle really makes sense so I want to

talk about that a little bit you know

many of you know the idea but let's just

discuss it for a moment ah we first

discuss it in the context of

electrodynamics how forces come out of

thinking now this is classical

electrodynamics for the moment the

complete field view of things

supposing I put two charges into space

and I want to know the force between

them how do I calculate it well you

could know the you could know the rule

that the force is equal to the product

of the charges times times 1 over R

squared and so forth or you could try to

calculate in a different way you could

try to say what does the what do these

two charges doom to space what they do

to space is they create electric fields

right the essentially that's the thing

they do they create an electric field

that fills space and I don't want to

write down the details of what that

electric field is but let's just say

this is the electric field let's forget

the second particle and just write down

the electric field due to the first

particle whatever it is the electric

field due to the first particle

incidentally it's proportional to the

electric charge of the first particle so

let's explicitly put that in E of the

first particle times the electric field

are divided by the electric charge this

electric field here I've divided out the

electric charge maybe I shouldn't call

it e let's call it e without the factor

of the electric charge in it and put a

little hat over it all right

that's this electric charge and what is

the field energy anybody know what the

formula for the field energy is in an

electric field electric fields have

energy they store their energy as a

distribution of energy in space and the

field energy the density of field energy

is the square of the electric field all

right so we square this and we integrate

it over all space the volume and that's

the energy stored in this on the

electric field of the particle now this

energy does not depend on where we put

the particle right the field will move

if we move the particle the field will

move with it but the field energy will

always be the same the electric field

will adjust to the position of a charge

the field will always give rise to

exactly the same field energy and this

field energy here remember e equals

mc-squared that field energy is part of

the mass of the particle it contributes

the field contributes to the energy of

the particle and therefore it

contributes to the mass of the particle

is another way of thinking about a bit

of renormalization that there's some

extra mass there because the field

surrounds the particle in this way ok I

don't want to belabor that now I what

about the second particle supposing the

first particle wasn't there but the

second particle was there this of course

is the energy e not the electric field

this is the energy if there was only

particle to the field energy would be

the integral of e two times

the electric field of the second

particle squared now if the two

particles are not at the same place well

let's not worry about this this one is

would also be independent of the

position of this particle here what

about the energy if I have both

particles if I have both particles then

I have to add up the field first before

squaring it so the electric field if I

have two particles will be the sum of

the two electric fields electric field

not the not energy let's call this

energy e in h well let's not call it H

energy just n on the energy first of all

the electric field the electric field

will be the sum of the two electric

fields the electric field will be e e 1

plus e1 e1 plus e2 e2 where these are

the electric fields of particle 1 and

particle 2 this will be the total

electric field incidentally the electric

fields are vectors and so we might put

little vector signs above them the field

energy you get by squaring this whole

thing so the field energy is the

integral over space there are three

terms the first term is e 1 squared e 1

squared gotten by squaring this the

second term is plus e 2 squared e 2

squared and the third term is the

interesting one it's the product of e 1

e 2 twice as a matter of fact times e 1

dot e 2 actually dot product alright

what is this first term here

it's the self energy of one particle by

itself it doesn't depend on the position

of the particle it's just a number it's

part of the mass of a particle let's

forget it it's already there as part of

the mass of the particle what about this

one also part of the self energy of the

second particle what about this one here

this one is not the energy of either

particle separately it's proportional to

the product of the charges and it's

proportional to the product of the

fields what if the particles were

infinitely far away so far away that

their Coulomb fields hardly overlap at

all you take one particle so far away

that the Coulomb fields are hardly

overlapping then this is going to be

zero because we're every one is not zero

e 2 will be zero or almost zero where

every two is nonzero e 1 will be close

to zero so this will be very very small

as you take the particles apart but what

about when you bring them together when

you bring them together the product of e

1 times e 2 will not be small nearby

where the particles are both fields will

be appreciable and you will get a

contribution from this what is that

contribution that contribution as a

function of distance well first of all

it's proportional to the product of the

charges it depends on the distance and

of course if you work at hours you might

expect it's nothing but the Coulomb

force 1 over R squared but I'd like to

say it this way because it gives you

with the following picture that putting

in both charges taking them far apart

they don't affect well Ledger they're

simply just independent objects as you

bring them together they deform and

distort the field in a way that depends

on the distance between them and the

distortions of the field in between them

that field energy that field energy

which is the contribution because both

of them are there that's the force law

so that's a purely field point of view

of forces a purely field point of view

of forces but if fields are nothing but

collections of quanta and quanta of

particles it must also be a way to think

about forces in terms of particles so

let's talk about that a little bit

before discussing electrodynamics in

this way let's talk about a slightly

different set up or completely do it

well actually a very completely

different set up let's talk about

molecular forces what the molecular

forces come from I'll give you one

source of them several four there are

several origins of molecular forces but

here's a set up I want to think about ah

let's begin with a pair of protons and a

single electron what is this proton over

here a proton over here and a single

electron if this proton were very far

away then the ground state of the

electron in the presence of the proton

would just be the hydrogen atom ground

state it would be governed by some sort

of shrouding a wave function let's draw

the Schrodinger wave function the ground

state would be the ground state of the

hydrogen atom and in the ground state if

this proton weren't there at all not

there at all the electron in its ground

state would certainly be found in the

position nearby this proton now what if

there are two protons over here not one

proton over here another proton over

here pretty far away but not infinitely

far away then there is another possible

state of the electron with exactly the

same energy where the electron is not

over here but it's over here with the

corresponding wave function be pushed

over to here that has exactly the same

energy why because the two protons are

the same kind and everything is

completely symmetric over here so if the

electron is

in orbit well and quantum mechanical

orbit around this proton of its room

quantum mechanical orbit around this

proton the ground state energy will be

exactly the same as if there was only

one proton but it's not quite true why

isn't it exactly true well if the

protons are not infinitely far away

there are processes that could happen

which could not happen if they were

infinitely far away anybody know what

the process is that can happen to the

electron if the two which tunneling

effect yeah

the tunneling effect the electron placed

over here into its ground state can with

a small probability suddenly appear in

this atom over here that's called

quantum mechanical tunneling it has to

overcome an energy barrier in between in

between the two it takes some energy to

pull the electron out of this atom it'll

get that energy back when it drops into

this atom but it has to go over this

hill can it go over the hill classically

it can't but quantum mechanically it can

tunnel from one place to another don't

stand there and try to watch the

tunneling what happens if you try to

watch for the electron going back and

forth like anything else in quantum

mechanics watching it ruins it you can

watch over here you can say well you can

stand over here and wait for the

electron to appear over here but if

you'll watch it from in here you'll ruin

the phenomenon so the electron can hop

back and forth hop back and forth simply

means is there's a tunneling transition

a tunneling rate or a tunneling

probability that if you put it over here

it can appear over here if it appears

over here and you wait a while it will

reappear over here and so forth okay

this process sets up a kind of

equilibrium long-term equilibrium in

which the electron has a equal

probability of being over here and over

here

with a wavefunction looks which looks

like the sum of the two wave functions

well the sum divided by the square root

of two in order for probability to add

up to one alright so it looks like the

sum of the two wave functions which I

didn't draw very well but in the middle

over here it's slightly different you

might you might draw the exact wave

function of the electron orbiting

particle one as if particle two were not

there

same thing for particle two and then add

them up well the correct tunneling wave

function the correct equilibrium wave

function is not exactly the sum of these

two wave functions it's a little bit

different in here a little bit not much

but the point is the energy of the

system is not exactly what it would be

if the two protons were infinitely far

away from each other if they were

infinitely far away from each other

you could put the proton the electron

over here it would have a certain energy

or over here and it would have exactly

the same energy when you put them closer

together the energy of the electron is

not exactly the same as it would be if

the if they were far apart they were

infinitely far apart so if I were to

plot the energy if I were to plot the

energy as a function of the distance

between them when they're very very far

apart the energy of that electron is

simply the energy of the electron with

only one proton and the other one just

not there at all at large distances the

energy would just be whatever it was but

as you bring the protons together the

energy of that two protons plus electron

is a little bit less

turns out to be a little bit less and

that a little bit less is a function of

the distance between them so now we have

a situation when the system is in

equilibrium with the electron tunneling

back and forth and in equilibrium

between the two the energy is a function

of the distance between them what's the

relationship between force and energy

you can think of this as potential

energy you can think of this as a

potential energy between the two protons

the derivative of the energy so the

derivative of the energy the energy has

a gradient in here force always pours

pushes you towards decreasing and so

this effectively creates an attraction

between the two protons that attraction

is a kind of covalent bond it's a kind

of force between the two of them which

is due to the sharing of an electron or

to the fact that the electron can be in

a superposition of quantum states in the

two wells in the two potentials of these

two things here now does that mean that

a proton and another proton with an

electron between them which has this

attractive force will bind together not

quite because there's another force

around what's the other force around

electrostatic force the system doesn't

have zero charge altogether and so

there's a repulsion force and the

repulsion force can overwhelm the

attraction force but nevertheless there

is a force between two protons if there

is an electron around which is due in a

sense to the jumping back and forth of

the electron or to the diminishing of

the energy by the wavefunction sort of

adjusting a little bit a little bit

better than it would if you just add the

two wave functions together um as I said

that's the origin of covalent bonds

sharing the sharing of electrons and in

this case you can think of

you can draw a picture now the picture

may or may not do anything for you

you have a proton over here that's the

world line of a proton another world

line of a proton and the electron might

start out being bound to this proton hop

across to this proton hop back across to

this proton you shouldn't take this too

literally because if you stood in the

middle as I said you would disrupt the

process but it's a description of the

quantum mechanical state of the electron

in between the two protons what it does

this possibility of the electron jumping

back and forth lowers the energy

relative so if you just had one proton

and just one electron in the bound state

there that means that there is an

effective force and you know you can

picture it this is this picture is a

very is like any analogy it's often very

very misleading but the presence of the

electron in between the two protons

creates an attractive force it's called

particle exchange

it's called particle exchange or

electron exchange between the two

between the two protons now yeah could

you think of it as being the electrons

hopping back and forth

positive charge no I don't think that

that is quite the right picture it

doesn't really depend on the electric

charges it just depends on the fact that

you can find by adding together two wave

functions you can find a wave function

with a little bit lower energy than

either one separately this was like Lex

like what I used to say like black light

wife's like I don't know no no no he was

probably talking about the boza

statistics of that photons like to like

to be in the same state I don't know

what he was talking about you saying he

said like lights light like electrons

like each other no no electrons hate

each other they don't like to be in the

same state photons like each other they

love to be in the same state I think he

was probably talking about the the

opposite of the exclusion principle for

photons the boza statistics of them now

because I don't know protons yeah

that's because of their electric charge

it does a little bit but not not very

much and in fact the the force due to

the electron jumping back and forth is a

much shorter range force than the

electrostatic attraction so this force

would only be important that relatively

small distances whereas the Coulomb

force would fall off much more slowly so

the Coulomb force would be a longer

range force but you know it is there it

is there the places where it shows up is

if you have a neutral system I mean it

shows up better if you have a neutral

system if you have two electrons so that

the total charge of the system is zero

then of course you have the possibility

one electron orbiting around this proton

a second electron orbiting around this

proton here now the two objects here

they call atoms hydrogen atoms

then neutral there is no electrostatic

force between them but you still have

this possibility of electrons jumping

across electrons can jump across a

tunnel across and then it does create an

attractive force which can binder bind

and atom binding I molecule but even so

a mistake in h2 plus is bound

yeah yeah yeah it is bound but hmm yeah

at small distances at small distances it

is enough to overcome the Coulomb force

that's right

since creates and

well it doesn't create a third force but

it creates a sort of slightly nonlinear

effect due to the cell with two to the

two forces but there it's just a

solution of the Schrodinger equation in

the presence of the two forces does not

have the energy that it would have if it

was just one of those charges there but

though let's let's serve let's let's

leave it at that there is this notion of

the energy being lowered by the

possibility of alternating between two

quantum states

not so much quantum entanglement that

some it's related to what are called off

diagonal elements in the Hamiltonian but

which is it's not too closely related to

entanglement I would say for

entanglement normally you need two

electrons you only need one electron for

this

for our very hot very very high

temperatures this electron much higher

well at high temperatures at high

temperatures because it depends on the

temperature at very very high

temperatures all it will happen is the

electron will get kicked out and you

know go to Alpha Centauri and it won't

even remember the fact that there was a

proton around if it gets hit hard enough

by a very hot Photon

but if the if the temperature is not

that extreme what it can do is cause

even if you only had a single atom it

could cause the electron to occupy

higher levels now higher levels have

bigger wave functions so the overlap

between the higher wave functions could

be larger and it would certainly have

some effect on the force but that's a

kind of special effect all right we have

we have a concept that we see in the

classical electrodynamics that the

effect of having two charges changes the

energy in between relative to what it

would have been if you only had one and

it creates a force similar kind of thing

here if you have two four centers and

the possibility of the fault of the

electron being in a superposition of

states in other words of the of the

equilibrium being in a quantum

superposition of the two states the two

states being over here or over here that

also lowers the energy and creates a

force is there a way to think about the

Coulomb force here in quantum mechanics

where it is in some sense similar to

this jumping back and forth of the

electron yeah there is let's come back

to a single proton a single proton is

interacting with the electromagnetic

field that means it's interacting with

the field whose quanta are photons

classically we might just describe it by

solving the field equations for the

electric field in the presence of a

charged particle quantum mechanically we

think about it differently particularly

in quantum field theory we think about

it as the emission and absorption of

photons right that's what the Lagrangian

of quanta of electrodynamics tells us it

tells us about the probability for the

emitting and absorbing absorption of

photons so one way of thinking about the

electron is that the actual physical

electron is a quantum mechanical

superposition of states in which first

of all there are no photons

a superposition of a state with no

photons a superposition of states in

which a photon has been emitted and

therefore there's a photon present so

it's a charged particle together with a

photon around two photons can be emitted

the photon can be reabsorbed the net

effect in the end is some kind of

equilibrium distribution quantum

mechanical equilibrium distribution of

photons surrounding the electron and you

can measure those photons I mean a

little bit different than measuring free

photons these photons are sort of

trapped at the electron they're emitted

and reabsorbed and if I have another

electron over here that is also emitting

and absorbing photons so there's an

equilibrium ok but every so often now

this should be thought of in the

language of Fineman diagrams every so

often a photon which is emitted from

here gets absorbed over here I always

think about it as two jugglers each

juggling balls and every so often if

they happen to be close enough together

a mistake will be made and Jo will grab

Mo's of juggling objects okay really

what you really want to do is you really

want to calculate the energy due to the

electromagnetic field or due to the

quantum superposition of photons that

are present you want to calculate that

energy as a function of the distance

between the charged particles when

they're very far apart the two energies

just add you just get the sum of the

energy of one charged particle and

another charged particle but as they get

closer together the charges begin to

influence each other or in the language

of Fineman diagrams the emission of one

photon by one particle and

option of that same photon by another

particle creates a force creates an

energy which is not exactly the sum of

the two energies and that energy is the

Coulomb force between the between the

charged particles so we have two

distinct languages well apart from just

the writing down the Coulomb force law

we have two other ways of thinking about

forces one of them is two classical

field theory where you calculate the

fields of objects and square them and

the other way is through the exchange of

particles Fineman diagrams where

particles are exchanged back and forth

any particle can be exchanged in some

context or another so every kind of

particle in one way or another produces

a force in molecular physics

it's the exchange of electrons which

create forces in electrodynamics

it's the exchange of photons back and

forth which create forces so any

particle any particle is also connected

with a force when that particle can be

exchanged or jump back and forth between

two slits

something else will describe some more

examples but I did want before we move

on to just discuss the relationship

between particles and forces so a

more-or-less have a one to one to one

correspondence particles fields for

which those particles are the quanta and

forces which are associated with

exchange processes where that particular

kind of particle can bounce or jump back

and forth that's so that's an important

theme so when people say that there are

four forces in nature now there's a

force for every possible kind of

particle and we will discuss some of

them as we go along okay I think it's

comes that it's time now to start naming

the particles listing them listing their

properties and

discussing what they can do what kind of

processes they can engage in and I could

write down a big long list of all the

elementary particles and then give you a

test next week to see whether you

memorized it or not that wouldn't be fun

at all I think it's probably better to

divide them up into small groups groups

which are in some way simply related to

each other get familiar with them a

little bit and what they can do before

we try to write down the whole damn

standard model of particle physics which

is a monstrosity I mean you know it's

it's not my fault

certainly not my fault that the standard

model of elementary particle physics is

an ugly monstrous mess it's not Steve

Weinberg's fault it's nobody's fault or

if it is somebody's fault that person

really may be in the room but there's a

little bit diffuse frankly we don't

understand why the particles are what

they are we don't understand why there

is an electron and no elect and and no

particle whose name my slips my mind

because nobody's ever named it because

it doesn't exist but nevertheless why

some particles exist and why other kinds

of particles don't exist we largely by

and large don't know we do understand

some relationships between particles if

this one and that one and that one

exists then there's got to be another

one to match up with them in some

appropriate way but in the end of the

day um there are many more parameters

many more different types of particles

then there are known relationships

between them which cut down the size of

a problem okay the the mathematics and

the relationships cut down the size of

the problem somewhat factor of two

factor of three or something like that

but there are hundreds of particles so

it is honestly a mess if you want to

understand what people are hoping for in

the next round of experiments and so

forth you'll have to understand

in some of that mess and what the

puzzles are about it so let's begin

let's name the particles we begin with

the most obvious ones let's make a table

let's see we need some columns we can

put the name of the particle over here

I'll put the symbol for the particle

over here I'll put the particle type

over here now what do I mean by type I

simply mean whether it's a fermion o

boson I'll put the electric charge over

here there's another quantity which

characterizes particles we'll call it

the baryon number I'll tell you what it

is as we go along and there are other

part there are other properties at the

moment I'm not listing them and we'll

put the mass over here all right the

first one of course and I'm not listing

them in any particular order as it

happens I'm if I am writing down the

lightest one first the lightest one is

of course the photon the standard symbol

for a photon is a gamma like for gamma

ray it has a field associated with it

the gamma particle is the quantum of a

field in most cases or many cases the

field carries the same symbol as the

particle itself but for the photon the

field is called a and it's really the

vector potential of the electromagnetic

field you could use electric or magnetic

fields but you can also use the vector

potential which is another way of

describing the electromagnetic field it

has it's a boson I didn't write down the

spin but the spin is one unit of spin

the electric charge is zero the baryon

number whatever that is is zero and the

mass is zero

so that's the first particle next

particle of interest is the electron now

the electron is a particle which has an

anti particle it has an electric charge

if it has an electric charge it must

have an anti particle of the opposite

charge and it is a convention whether we

name the whether we think of the

particle as the electron and the anti

particle as the positron or whether we

think of the positron as the particle

and the electron is the anti particle

the relation between them is mutual

alright so when I like the electron I

really mean the electron and positron

and so we could write a here plus minus

standing II - is the electron a plus is

the positron the field of the electron

is usually Sai and maybe you could put a

little Eden stairs to indicate that it

stands for the electron it made up out

of creation and annihilation operators

for electrons electrons are fermions

it's charged okay it's charged in what

units now well the standard particle

physics or quantum mechanical unit for

electric charge believe it or not is the

electric charge of an electron it's a

good unit to work in terms of you can go

look it up in coulombs it's 10 to the

minus what 23 cool 10 minus 19 coulombs

order yeah it's some very small charge

but but it's not useful to think about

it in coulombs all particles in nature

have electric charges which are integer

multiples of the electron charge this

could not true of quarks but quarks are

not observable particles all right so

the challenge we'll just write as minus

1 for the electron and plus 1 for the

positron

so since we typically took think of the

electron as a particle and the positron

as the anti particle let's just call it

minus one and remember that the positron

has the opposite charge baryon number is

zero and it's mass now we have to decide

on units for mass units for mass are the

same as units for energy e equals MC

squared so we can either describe the

mass as our mass and kilograms or an

energy in joules or we can simply invent

a new unit which is more appropriate for

microscopic physics two atomic physics a

in fact the unit that we use comes

originally historically out of atomic

physics it is the unit in which the

ionization energy of an electron in a

hydrogen atom is what thirteen point

five electron volts an electron volt is

how much energy you get if you pass an

electron from a across a capacitor plate

of one volt

it's a very very small amount of energy

some tiny fraction of a Joule but one

electron volt is the standard unit that

came historically out of atomic physics

the theory of electrons and so forth

it's going to wind up being too small a

unit for us particle physics energies

are larger than atomic physics energies

but for historical reasons we have the

electron volt is our unit of energy and

the mass of an electron measured in

electron volts is of order a million

electron volts one MeV in fact it's a

half an electron volt not exactly

I think it's point five one MeV and MeV

stands for millions of electron volts an

MeV will be too small a unit for many

other purposes as I said the particle

physics is a mess and the masses of

particles extend all over the map

and so in trying to search for a useful

unit you're always frustrated the useful

unit will always be too small for the

next know why no it's exactly 0.51 no

it's not what's that pi 3 pi equals 3

right okay now we can start let quantum

electrodynamics is the theory of

electrons and photons and we've talked

about it a little bit more than a little

bit and just we could also write down

over here a table of the various of them

let me get a table we'll just make we'll

just draw some pictures the basic arm

elementary process that takes place in

quantum electrodynamics photons and

electrons is the emission of a photon by

an electron electron electron Photon and

as I've showed you several times you can

rearrange the legs of this diagram so

that this could represent not the

emission of a photon but the absorption

of a photon photon comes in from the

past or whoops sorry

you can even flip the electron legs

around so that it looks like this

electron going backward in time or what

does that mean that really means a

positron emitting a photon so the basic

building block for building up processes

and interactions is this vertex with two

electrons electron positron whatever

coming one going in when going out and a

photon coming out of it or going into it

out of that you build up all of the

various processes of quantum

electrodynamics but in particular the

process or the the phenomena that

corresponds to the force between charges

and in the language of particle exchange

it's the photon

on bouncing back and forth between

charged particles which which creates

that force yet another way to describe

what's going on here is in terms of a

Lagrangian or a term in the Lagrangian

the Lagrangian describing this process

here describes one electron in one

electron out and one photon out and so

you build that out of the field

operators one electron in Si electron it

ki it creates it as the creation and

annihilation operators in it an electron

out and subside dagger of the electron

and a photon emitted is the field

operator for the photon and if you plug

in all the creation and annihilation

operators you will find in here buried

in here terms where a photon is emitted

an electron absorbed another electron

emitted and so forth and this codifies

this describes all of the various basic

processes that can happen in quantum

electrodynamics now there's a parameter

in Lagrangian appears the electric

charge of the electron and that roughly

speaking is associated with the

amplitude for a electron to emit a

photon an electron let's say you hit the

electron or whatever the electron plows

into the side of a x-ray machine what's

the probability that a photon will be

emitted well the amplitude is the

electric charge and the probability is

proportional to the square of the

electric charge so all of this here is a

way of describing all of these basic

processes and when they're combined

together they produce forces they

produce processes where photons are

emitted the whole world of quantum

electrodynamics flows out of this

basically one expression here we won't

try to go through that again now

ah but let's start adding a little bit

to a particle list the next particles of

interest these are of course familiar to

you I'm sure right now if this were 1960

when I still when I was 1962 when I went

to graduate school probably the next

particles I might write down would be

protons and neutrons protons and

neutrons are now subsumed by quarks it

is widely believed that in some sense

protons and neutrons are composites of

quarks

although we will call remind me to come

back to this issue of the difference or

what what it means to become positive

versus elementary it's a very

interesting story but naively quarks are

smaller than protons and neutrons and so

protons and neutrons which are big fat

globs are made up out of quarks so next

thing are quarks

there's a lot of quarks we won't even

get the all of them tonight or the whole

set of distinctions between them I don't

think we will but there's more than one

type of quark there are six types of

quarks six distinct particles all of

which are very similar to each other in

some respects very different from each

other in different other respects so

let's list them there are they go under

they have names all right well why do

they called what they are they called

what they are just historically randomly

people assigned the silly names to them

and there's no logic to what they call

no logic at all this first of all the up

quark and that's called you the symbol

is you well let's see we should write

there a quarks here quarks and I suppose

the symbol for quarks is Q

all quarks or fermions will write down

their charge later they have all baryon

number of 1/3

now why 1/3 well the reason is very

simple

the baryon number is basically the

counting of the number of protons and

neutrons each proton is counted as

having one unit of baryon number each

Neutron is carrier counter that's

covering one unit of a baryon is just a

word for protons and neutrons and a

somewhat generalization of protons and

neutrons nucleon is a word for protons

and neutrons there are other particles

which we'll come to which are very

similar to para 2 protons and neutrons

they're also called baryons the prefix

barrier I think means heavy and baryons

we'll call baryons because there are a

lot heavier than electrons but counting

up the number of protons and neutrons

what do you call the number of protons

plus neutrons in an atom atomic weight

yeah I was the atomic weight yeah the

atomic weight R is equal approximately

equal to the total number of protons and

neutrons and the total number of protons

and neutrons and nuclear physics never

changes protons can turn into neutrons

neutrons can turn into protons plus

other things but the number of protons

plus neutrons never changes and hmm you

do have isotopes but still a number of

protons plus neutrons doesn't change

number of protons can change how the

hell can a number of protons change oh

yeah indeed they do but are there

processes with number of protons and

neutrons change protons not plus

neutrons but protons and/or neutrons

change beta decay radioactivity in

radioactivity one form of radioactivity

a neutron decays into a proton plus an

electron and an anti-neutrino okay so in

that process

the number of protons changes by one the

number of neutrons changes by one but

the number of protons plus neutrons

doesn't change ah there's a

generalization of that in all of nuclear

physics and particle physics there's a

certain quantity which for ordinary

nuclear physics is just the number of

protons plus neutrons and that number is

sometimes called the baryon number or

have to generalize it a little bit

beyond protons and neutrons

it's the baryon number and it could have

been defined to be two for the proton or

seven for the proton or pi for the

proton but whatever it is it has to be

defined as twice as much for two protons

three times as much for three protons so

it's a convention that you say the

baryon number of the proton is one

incidentally what's the baryon number of

the antiproton minus one minus one

proton has baryon number plus one

antiproton baryon number minus one

Neutron barrier number one antineutron

baryon number minus one but clearly

there's an element of convention exactly

what you call them

but once it was fixed that the barrier

on them of a proton was one then the

barrier number of a quark was a third

because three quarks make a proton okay

so it's just a historical glitch that

the baryon number of the most

fundamental thing in nuclear physics is

one third and not one what about an anti

quark

there are anti quarks barian number is

minus 1/3 and so I won't write that down

separately

the number of corpses conserved number

of quarks minus the number of anti

quarks is conserved now whether or not

that is an absolute conservation law it

is not believed to be an absolute

conservation law what do I mean by

absolute conservation law can a proton

disappear like a king completely

disappear its energy has to go someplace

are there processes in nature where a

proton might disappear and cut and

become something that is neither a

proton or a neutron or anything else

that you would call a baryon for example

without violating charge conservation a

proton could become a positron and a

photon so a proton could decay into a

positron and a photon does it well you

can wait if you have a single proton and

you sit there and wait you will wait a

long long time before that proton decay

is its half-life the decay that way is

at least 10 to the 33 or 10 to the 34

years so this is not something that

happens very regularly does it happen at

all the thinking is yes it does but this

is one of the very very interesting

questions of particle physics of whether

the proton can decay and when you say

can it decay you mean decay into

something that does not carry a baryon

number and there's widely believed that

the answer is yes but has never been

demonstrated sadly how do you have you

wait around for 10 to the 34 years for

proton to decay you get 10 to the 34 you

protons and you wait around for one of

them and you see one now 10 to the 34

protons is a lot of protons

no that that's not that that that's zero

barian number begins goes to zero baryon

number proton has baryon number one

antiproton is barrier number -1 so

that's not a baryon we call them baryon

violating processes processes in which

the baryon number is not conserved

nobody has ever witnessed such a process

in the laboratory or anyplace else can

they happen it does not seem to be any

reason why they cannot happen built into

the mathematics of what we know so we

leave this as an open question but

empirically and at least to a very very

high precision baryon number is

conserved and quirks by definition have

one third of a unit one third of a unit

as I said minus the third for anti

quirks but in order to fill in the rest

of this in particular electric charge

and mass we have to label which kind of

quark we're talking about and there are

lots of different kinds of quarks so

let's put in a list of different kinds

of quarks

this is not new particles which are not

quarks this is just the subheading here

quarks and then things underneath there

are up quarks down quarks why are they

up and down and not up and down there's

nothing up and down about them hmm

what directions up and down up and down

means in the Earth's gravitational field

is nothing up EE or down e about them

all right then it gets worse

there are strange quarks which are no

stranger than non strange works it gets

more and silly there are charm quarks

which are charming I suppose I don't

know and then there are that this is if

you don't you know if you're if you're

squeamish or you know very give up

quarks arm quarks bound works and then

top quarks and the symbols are of course

exactly the same I just didn't feel like

writing the words up down strange charm

bottom top same as bottom and top I got

a little pretentious beauty in truth so

bottom and top strange and charm how and

under what circumstances these things

when named is not not interesting I

don't know I do know but never mind

they're all fermions okay the symbols

are just what I wrote here they're all

free some sometimes Q sometimes sy q

sometimes capital Q sometimes depending

if you're talking about the individual

types of them you'll just use UDS CBOT

use the same names for the fields as

used for the particles and there's no

completely coherent convention that

everybody sticks to all right they're

all fermions the whole lot of them are

fermions as I said but now comes the

charges so it's useful to divide them

into groups of two these groups of two

are sort of repetitions of each other

this group of two in many ways is

isomorphic not exactly to this

- which is the same is not the same but

which follows the same pattern the

pattern of these two is similar to the

pattern of these two similar where I got

them upside down excuse me wait if I

want to keep the pattern let me see I

think I want to put down up down up

strange down up strange charm bottom top

yeah ah all right so the down up system

is very similar to the strange charm

system is very similar to the bottom top

position of the system so let's write

down what the electric charges are and

you can see them you can see this

similarity the down-up system has charge

minus 1/3 and 2/3 that's the first

example of particles in nature which

have charges which are not integer

multiples of the electric charge of

electron okay however quirks by

themselves do not exist freely in nature

they're always bound into other

structures protons neutrons and so forth

and those particles do have integer

charges ok the strange and the charm

exactly the same thing minus 1/3 and 2/3

bottom and top exactly the same minus

1/3 and 2/3 cannot be read they're just

repetitions of the same thing what about

the anti particles if I were to list the

anti particles over here they would just

have exactly the same charges as the

particles except opposite sign so this

is simply replication for some reason

nobody understands nobody even has any

idea why nature replicated itself this

way

yeah they're all baryon number one third

right okay and then the masses the

masses are not similar to each other the

masses wildly vary I'm going to put down

estimates for them because the precise

value are there are precise values of

the masses but you can go look them up

on Google or wherever you want the down

quark is about 10 MeV so it's 50 times

heavier than the electron a lot lighter

than the proton incidentally what's the

proton mass 89 1800 times the electron

mass there is about 940 MeV this is a

lot lighter than a proton the up quark

about 5 MeV less than the vendor down

quark and protons are made only out of

up quarks and down quarks so it doesn't

look like there's nearly enough mass in

quarks to to be the mass of a proton or

neutron ok we'll come back to that point

is of course there's more in a proton

than just a it's quirks ok strange and

charm strange is roughly order magnitude

100 MeV a strange and charm is little

over about a thousand MeV now notice

that the down quark is heavier than the

up quark but the strange quark which is

analogous to the down quark is lighter

than the charm quark so there's some

pattern of inversion here of the masses

again nobody understands at all why

that's true yeah charm is about a

thousand twelve little more than that

whoo sorry 100 mr. zero decimal creep

okay a thousand mev and the bottom of

cork is about 5,000 oh this is called a

GeV Giga electron volt the bottom quark

see we keep changing units that's about

5 GeV and the top quark is about 170 GeV

so how much heavier is the top quark

than the up quark can anybody do that

calculation 100 how much 30,000 a lot a

lot all right so on the one hand these

particles are extremely similar to each

other they do the same things they have

the same properties and yet they have

masses which wander all over the map

does anybody understand why no are there

any ideas yes do any of them work No

we don't even have a clue about why

there's first of all we don't even

understand of course why there's even

one of them one family these are called

families why is there one family well we

don't know but for sure if there wasn't

one family we wouldn't be here cuz there

would be no protons and neutrons but

given that there's this one family of up

quarks and down quarks why are the

strange quarks and charm quarks or top

quarks and bottom quarks nobody has a

clue stupid question yeah when these

quarks were found the story goes they

were looking in a certain place because

the mass said the mass should be certain

notes they said they said that they went

through the calculations and they knew

that this is where it is going to be it

was going to be somewheres around some a

GeV they're going to foil the top quark

yeah not a predicted it would be there

before they yeah but not on the basis of

you know abstract theory but on the

basis of you know how the top quark

would affect the road work its way into

other particles and I was just sitting

because you just said it

nobody knows why and they're all over

the ballpark and yet they seem to know

that that's where they wanted to look

for ya but not not because not because

there was any basic underlying reason

why the top quark had that mass what you

could do is because they supposing the

top quark had a certain mass and then

calculate various Fineman diagrams

involving the top quark in various ways

finding diagrams involving ordinary

particles not the top quark but which

had top quarks running around in the

interior of diagrams okay you calculate

those diagrams those diagrams have an

effect on processes involving other

particles that you know very well and

then you say how what does the mass of

this top quark have to be in order that

it does the right thing for these other

particles right so it was not in any

sense a deep understanding of why the

mass of the top quark was what it was it

was simply an observation that you

needed that particular value of the top

quark mass in order that it rather be

consistent with

how it all disappeared what will happen

if ours the direction go ahead you're

asking anything to say that you can't

detect the quark becomes us to a certain

extent a matter of definition what it

means to detect the quark

you can certainly detect evidence of

quarks what you can't do is create an

isolated quark in isolation from other

things and then examine it but we'll

come we're going to come to the question

I think you're probably marketing about

jets produced well I don't know what

you're talking about

yeah we can talk about jets combine

let's come back to it after we've after

we

price charge Nestle balance nose is that

you're interested okay Semmy theory yeah

some extent that that that is understood

not going to explain it now but now I'm

telling you the facts we can talk about

how much of this is explained and how

much of it how much of the pattern is

the right question is how much of this

pattern is required for theoretical

mathematical consistency but we haven't

gotten it yet some of this pattern is

required yeah some of this pattern is

required but not much of it very little

of it is required by question it's a

melting the balance of this experiment

works no relative abundance and where

but what do you mean very little bonus

meaning the world in the universe there

are very there are neutrons are unstable

they decay protons are stable they exist

in intergalactic space and everything

else they're all yeah the only thing

that has any appreciable abundance only

alright first of all the only quarks

which have any degree of stability are

ups and bounds the rest of these decay

to these so really the real abundance of

real particles in the universe are all

ups and downs okay now what's the

relative abundance of ups and downs

that's determined by how many quirks of

each type there are in a proton there

are no neutrons or sorry of course there

are neutrons there are neutrons and

atoms are in nuclei so you have to know

the relative abundance of protons and

neutrons to

know the relative abundance of it but

that's all it is relative abundance of

protons and neutrons okay so what do we

know what is a proton and what is a

neutron in this language and let's come

over here a proton is three quarks a

neutron is three quarks now as I said

I'm now in the business of telling you

facts about these particles not at this

point trying to understand why these are

the facts we can't do everything at once

a neutron is two down quarks and an up

quark let's just check that an up quark

has charged two thirds and the down

quark has charged minus 1/3 so 2/3 minus

1/3 minus another third this is

electrically neutral charge equals zero

that's good Neutron has charge zero

proton proton is exactly the same as a

neutron except with an interchange of up

quarks and down quarks two up quarks and

a down quark now up quarks and down

quarks are a lot alike except for their

electric charge the electric charge has

to do with the interaction with photons

let's forget photons let's forget about

the existence of photons for the moment

and just talk about quarks and the other

particles which are important inside the

nucleus and so forth then it would

almost seem that a neutron and a proton

of the same thing except for an

interchange of the up label and the down

label you might then surmise that they

are that their properties are almost

exactly the same if for some reason the

electric charge is unimportant in other

words supposing we don't have to worry

about the interaction with

photons just forget photons then it

would seem that protons and neutrons

should be identical because what's the

difference you just replaced up quarks

by down quarks but it's not quite true

because up quarks and down quarks don't

have exactly the same mass all right

they don't have exactly the same mass

now ten MeV by comparison with the mass

of a proton is small it's almost

negligible it is very small and it's

almost negligible in nuclear physics or

in our particle physics and so to a to

some precision to the extent that you

can ignore the masses of the quarks

which are after all smaller by far than

the masses of protons and neutrons

neutrons and protons are a good deal

alike the only difference is the slight

difference in mass between the up quarks

and the down quarks which one is going

to be heavier the neutron or the proton

and of course it's going to be the one

with more down quarks because down

quarks are a bit heavier than up quarks

down quarks are a bit heavier than up

quarks and so it's likely that the

neutron is heavier than the proton and

it is okay neutron is a little bit

heavier than the proton and it's largely

attributed to the AH to the fact that

the neutron has more down quarks now

that's not all there is to the

difference between protons and neutrons

if the down quarks and the up quarks

have exactly the same mass but you

accounted for electromagnetism in other

words the photon so okay the photon is

not completely unimportant then which

would be heavier the proton or the

neutron why yes because it has some

electrostatic self energy because it's

charged okay so the proton would be a

little bit heavier because of the

electric the self energy of the

electromagnetic field the electric field

one would expect the proton to be a

little bit heavier in fact the neutron

is a little bit heavier ah

and the reason is because the down quark

is a little bit heavier than the up

quark okay but other than that yeah

neutron is about what 938 MeV and proton

is about 939 MeV ER that was about 1.4

MeV MeV difference between them

something like about 1.4 MeV difference

between any there's enough energy

between them there's enough energy

separating them that the neutron can

afford a little bit of energy to when it

decays into a proton plus an electron

plus a neutrino it's a little bit of

excess energy in the neutrino which

allows it to decay and it allows it in

particular to decay with an electron to

electron okay so that's the very very

rough story of protons and neutrons

we'll come back to it but now there are

also these strange quarks

let's forget charm quarks for a moment

there's an interesting question can you

replace them notice that in every

respect the down quarks and the strange

quarks are similar to each other except

for the fact that the mass is different

so you might ask can you construct an

analogue of the proton and neutron where

you pull out a Down quark and replace it

by a strange quark or perhaps two

strange quarks pull out a Down quark and

replace it by a strange quark the answer

is yes of course you can because at

every respect the up quarks and the down

quarks are the same it's sort of almost

like an isotope you pull out a proton

and put it in a neutron and it sort of

sticks together so the same way but it's

even better here ah so you can construct

another kind of analogue it's called

strange baryons strange baryons I forget

their names lambdas and sighs they've

got all kinds of me

and I did you know it's been so long

since I since I worked on these things

that I can't even remember their names

they have symbols like this associated

with them like this and they're lambdas

I don't remember which one is which not

important but for example you can create

the Lord's name is I pull out a Down

quark and create a strange and a down

and an up what's the mass of this one

over here sorry not the mass what is the

charge of this one well it's exactly the

same as a neutron because you pulled out

it down and put in an S and the s and

the down have the same charge alright so

this is also electrically neutral but it

has a strange quark in it and it's

called a strange baryon okay they're not

stable they can decay we're going to

discuss the the decay processes later

but they're not completely stable so

they evaporate then this one will turn

into that one but yes they do exist

likewise you can put in two strange

quirks and an up quark what is the

charge of that one same thing charge

neutral again and likewise likewise for

the proton you can replace it by up up

and strange so there are all these

strange baryons dangerous

those became what what kind of process

what products do you Oh perfect neutrons

only photons in neutrons ah for Pyro's

or things like an electron another

chance

what can't just

in also only substituted strangers for

boundaries no you can't know what this

well the rules of what you can exchange

are a little bit complicated but at the

moment you can always exchange one for a

similar one of the same charge all right

now you can also oh in SCID ently these

strange particles are a little bit

heavier than the protons and neutrons

because of this extra 90 MeV of erm

extra 90 MeV 90 MeV isn't much all right

so there's somewhat heavier than the

ordinary protons and neutrons but in

every respect they're similar the main

difference of importance is because

they're heavier they can decay to the

protons and neutrons and and so they're

not found in university lovers

all those that you put up there so far

can be constructed with any pork sausage

oh yes yeah you'll have to take every

particle and replace it by its anti

particle then it becomes the antineutron

the antiproton and the anti question

mark people will be strange that's the

strange this is not just another word

for saying I have a strange wood but if

you push you to the bottom for kidding

okay then they become bottom then the

bottom baryons yeah yeah yeah strange

are they strange I don't know Abby they

will call strange because you know

people became familiar with protons and

neutrons by the 1950s and then when they

discovered these other things who has

strange and unexpected the fans yeah

we're soon to see

listen master - what do you know Sophia

that mess oh you mean if you just add it

up the master the quirks right yeah

that's right there's a lot missing so it

must be something else in the proton in

the Tron no no they're gluons you know

no no no no attempt here to be dramatic

ah but the gluons don't carry any

interesting charge baryon number do they

carry mass well they carry energy so as

it's a form of binding energy here

that's right it's binding energy

energies don't add not relativistically

I mean well mass is don't add the mass

of an object is not necessarily the

masses of constituents

well the 20 was saying about beautifully

with the bomb you're using the language

of particles here to describe these and

positive particles it seems more

complicated at least the word language

appeals

how would you combine it it seems like

you would combine everywhere not to be a

particle through your field you want to

know whether you can construct a field

describing a proton

down up as if they're particles you

think Oh minuscule yeah they're

everywhere and your modes of the field

are combining to form these composite

particles Oh in thinking yeah I mean in

thinking about this particular aspect of

things it's much easier to think about

about particles than fields is we could

think about it in terms of fields but

it's much harder

and question about the binding Eris's

yeah so if you if this difference

between the Corp energies and proton

energy we're binding actually that's a

big positive energy you know are not an

integer that's not an integer

energy oh I thought you said integer

yeah usually negative right right not

true here well yeah I mean we'll come to

it but yeah sure ah yes yes let's let's

yes there is yes there is but not yet

let's talk first about mesons

massan's are simply quark antiquark now

why you know you could raise the

question why do three quarks bind

together to form something why don't two

quarks far buying together to form

something the the early days of core

ecology this was a complete mystery

why quarks always you could say oh it's

in order to make the charge and integer

multiple of the electron well that's a

stupid answer and tell not to be that

stupid but is it at this stage it's a

stupid answer but yet that is the

pattern that is the pattern that they

combine together in forms in which this

is not the only rule but this is one of

the rules of nature we do understand it

and we do understand where it comes from

but a rule a rule of thumb at the

present time is the way things bind they

always bind in two combinations which

have integer multiple of the electron

charge okay so you can take that as a

working rule temporarily until we have a

deeper understanding of it alright

mesons are also particles composite

particles which also have the property

that their charge is integer multiple

of the electron charge but they have

zero baryon number they do not have

baryon number which means that they must

be made that their core the combinations

of quarks they must be made of quarks

and antiquarks in fact they are quarks a

quark and an antiquark

there are quark and an antiquark and so

let's let's write down there are first

of all the ones that you can make only

out of ups and down quarks ups and down

quarks are special not in any deep sense

but they're special because they're much

lighter than the other particles they

don't decay or they don't decay as

rapidly if they do decay they're

abundant in nature and more than that

that doesn't take any energy and it

doesn't take much energy in collisions

to make them so of course they were the

first particles to be discovered things

made up of only up quarks and down

quarks the up quarks and down quarks are

pretty light and the massan's are

typically pretty light they're an up

quark at a down quarter and an anti or a

quark and an antiquark and then you can

start thinking about the different

combinations this is an up bar quark and

a down quark there's a down an up quark

and a down bar quark there's an up bar

and an up quark and there's a down bar

and a down quark I think I got them all

any quarter the offices no you can't do

that

don't they have to be the opposite time

because it's one third of the thirds so

it's not beef no ok let's let's work out

what their electric charges are the

electric charge of an up quark is minus

two thirds and this one is minus one

third though this has charge minus one

right minus 1/3 minus 2/3 that's fine

charge minus one is like like an

electronic all right what about this one

this is the anti particle of this hmm

this one's not this one is just the anti

particle of this oh yes right right this

one is the antha these two are anti

particles of each other because they are

related by changing particles into anti

particles down bar and two down up

aren't up and this has charge plus one

so these are anti particles of each

other up bar up that's electrically

neutral obviously and charge equals zero

now in fact neither one of these two by

themselves corresponds to distinct

particles remember we're doing quantum

mechanics each one of these states can

be thought of as a quantum state think

of it as a quantum state the quantum

state consisting of an anti up quark and

an up quark the quantum state consisting

of an anti down quark and a down quark

one of the things you can do in quantum

mechanics is to superpose States if you

have States you can add them you can

superpose them superposing them means

making combinations that have a

probability for being either this one or

this one right there are two

combinations of these two they would

tell you what they are they are up bar

up

Plus down bar down and what would I put

in front of it to make it have total

probability 1 1 over square root of 2

this is a quantum state and this is

another this is the orthogonal quantum

state up or up - down bar down you know

what this is this is an entangled pair

of quarks not entangled through this

spin but entangled through there up

Nisour down this if you thought of

openness and boundness is about being

similar analogous to the spin direction

of a particle up or down and that's

where this terminology came from then

these would be two entangled states and

tangled not through their spin but

through their ISO spin through their

upness and down this we haven't used the

word iso spin look maybe I'll tell you

what it means but not right now it is

just this analogy between the spin

directions and the up this or down this

quantum number these two things

individually are well-defined particles

this one over here goes together with

these two they are called the PI ons

they go together for a good reason for a

good mathematical reason but they go

together we'll have the right ones yeah

they go together because their mass is

very close to each other it is believed

there would be exactly the same mass if

the up quark and down quark had the same

exact mass if they were if the masses

were the same all three of these are

virtually indistinguishable except for a

small difference in their mass and they

have different charges 0 plus 1 and

minus 1 and this is called the PI on

multiplet pi plus minus and 0 3

independent kinds of particles called pi

ons and as i said and we can discuss why

nature chose these particular

combinations to be analogous to each

other but now i'm telling you facts and

not the non mathematics and the other

combination is simply this one over here

and this is called the ADA P so there's

the PI plus 2 for states here really

define 3 pi ons PI plus minus and 0 and

the ADA mess on the a numbness on is

similar to a PI on in many ways but it's

heavier why is it heavier that is a

complicated story it is not an

elementary story it's a complicated

story maybe we will come to it maybe we

won't but as a matter of fact it's

masked ok what are the masses the PI ons

the masses of the PI ons are about 140

MeV the mass of a PI on a supply on M PI

is about 140 MeV so in other words it's

not too different from question yeah

it's about 140 MeV so it's summarized in

this range in here not this heavy

and the mass of the ADA is about three

times heavier or something like that the

mass of the ADA is about five hundred

MeV I don't remember the precise number

but that's about right

why that is why the ADA sticks out as

being different was a puzzle for a long

time it's after not obvious not obvious

even today it's a rather mad abstract

mathematical fact but it is it is

understood also truth they're relatively

long

compared to most they don't decay by

strong interactions they decay by

weakened electromagnetic interactions so

they're longer lived then than many of

these these other particles yes that is

true right they are long with okay that

those are the mezzo no I've ever had

these by themselves they're really in

combination with other some differences

are there now definitely

is that so it isn't something like the

neutrino oscillations well in the sense

that it's related to super quantum

superpositions of states yes but it's

got more to do with spin combinations of

two half spin particles there are two

ways that you can entangle well we'll

come to our next time the last thing I

simply want to tell you is that you can

make strange mesons you can take any D

quark and replace it by a strange quark

strange bar quark and so forth that

makes new massan's which are called

strange mesons or what's the other name

for them k massan's

k massan's Armazones containing a

strange or an anti strange quark

replacing a down quark okay there are

four of them up bar strange up strange

bar down bar strange down strange bar

these two have charge zero charge zero

and these have charged plus one and

minus one these two are called the

charged K massan's these two are called

the neutral change the the neutral came

as ons so there are three kinds of pie

ons one kind of Ada and four kinds of

homies that make altogether let's see

three pi yarns for K mesons and an ADA

yeah there's more there's more there's

more oh did we leave something out yeah

we left out one we left out we left out

some yeah we left out s Bar s huh yeah

it's nothing

right nine nine altogether the reason

it's nine is simple there are three

coins of quarks three kinds of anti

quarks three times three is nine okay
